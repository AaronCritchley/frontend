on the future of the Labour party at HOME on August 13, 2015 in Manchester, England. Cooper will say Labour needs a radical platform to win in 2020. Cooper warned against bringing back the ideas and campaigns of the past and say we need new ideas, not old ideas, to rediscover our radicalism and win the next election.
