<p>Swinton, usually known for her androgynous style, has talked about women who adopt a similar look to her character in an interview with <a href=\"http://www.themarysue.com/interview-tilda-swinton-trainwreck/\">The Mary Sue</a>.</p> <p>“It’s fun to dress as someone different and this woman looks, frankly, like a lot of women I pass on the street every day, the women who go for that particular tandoori tan and the eye make-up and hair,” she said. “But for me, that look is pretty extreme.”</p> <p>The 54-year-old star of Michael Clayton and Only Lovers Left Alive plays the brash boss of Amy Schumer’s character in the new film and many critics have found her to be almost unrecognisable in the role.</p>  <figure class=\"element

But here we are and it’s available for everybody. You just have to go to a big make-up counter in a big department store and you, too, can get that look.”</p> <p>Trainwreck, directed by Judd Apatow, opened big in the US over the weekend with a $30.2m gross from a $35m budget. Swinton recently signed on to play opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in Marvel’s Doctor Strange. “I have yet to decide exactly where I’m going to place the gender of this character,” she said. “It’s not that I know and I’m not telling you - I have yet to decide that.” </p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The star is ‘delighted’ to be unrecognisable in her role as a glamorous magazine editor in comedy Trainwreck","headline":"Tilda Swinton calls out 'tandoori tan' women","byline":"Benjamin Lee","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4apv3","wordcount":"284","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/21/1437464749750/ad3122b2-faec-47ec-9d2b-4e2955bcdbd0-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-24T10:00:00+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The star is ‘delighted’ to be unrecognisable in her role as a glamorous magazine editor in comedy Trainwreck</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/21/tilda-swinton-calls-out-tandoori-tan-women-trainwreck","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/jul/21/tilda-swinton-calls-out-tandoori-tan-women-trainwreck","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/tilda-swinton","webTitle":"Tilda Swinton","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tilda-swinton","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/tilda-swinton","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/trainwreck","webTitle":"Trainwreck","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/trainwreck","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/trainwreck","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"fashion/makeup","webTitle":"Makeup","description":"Makeup news, reviews and advice from the Guardian and Observer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"fashion","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/makeup","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/makeup","sectionName":"Fashion","references":[]},{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"fashion","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benjamin-lee-film","webTitle":"Benjamin Lee","r2ContributorId":"68458","firstName":"benjamin","lastName":"lee","twitterHandle":"benfraserlee","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Benjamin Lee is a digital contributing editor for theguardian.com/film</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjamin-lee-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benjamin-lee-film","references":[]}]},{"elements":[{"id":"077d50ad0e888148e2cf57fc5ba64c5c39fba895","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/21/1437467778203/8084336e-5374-4174-9458-3c8f506f87f4-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/21/1437467778203/8084336e-5374-4174-9458-3c8f506f87f4-220x132.jpeg","source":"Disney","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Disney's The Sword in the Stone.","height":"132","credit":"Photograph: Disney","caption":"Once and future wring ...

take on the legend of King Arthur, The Sword in the Stone, as the studio continues its conveyor belt of live-action fantasy remakes. Game of Thrones writer-producer Bryan Cogman will work on the screenplay for the new version, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sword-stone-live-action-remake-809845\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/aladdin-disney-movie-live-action-prequel\">I loathe lamp: live-action Aladdin prequel to focus on Genie enslavement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Sword in the Stone is known as the final feature to be released prior to Walt Disney’s 1966 death. While not generally considered an out-and-out classic of the studio’s pioneering animated milieu, it holds a place in the hearts of some enthusiasts as a useful introduction to Arthurian myth for children. Others, however, see the film as a whimsical, and bizarrely Americanised take on TH White’s 1938 novel, from which it was loosely adapted: by way of example, the movie features a version of the sword Excalibur which Arthur draws from the stone in London, rather than the more traditional Camelot. </p> <p>The Sword in the Stone also continues the big screen renaissance of Arthur himself. British director Guy Ritchie is due to release Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur, which studio Warner Bros hopes will kick off a series of six new movies, in July 2016. The film stars Charlie Hunnam as Arthur, Jude Law as Vortigen, Eric Bana as Uther Pendragon, and according to some reports, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/12/david-beckham-in-grumpy-knight-cameo-in-guy-ritchie-king-arthur-film\">footballer David Beckham as a grumpy knight </a>who is unable to pull Excalibur from the stone.</p> <p>Arthurian myth has proven fertile ground for Hollywood over the years, with 2004’s King Arthur, starring Clive Owen as a Romano-British soldier during the last days of the Roman Empire in Britain, 1981’s Excalibur, starring Nigel Terry and Helen Mirren, and Richard Thorpe’s 1953 effort Knights of the Round Table some of the best known films about the famed Celtic ruler.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/31/guy-ritchie-right-director-king-arthur-epic\">Is Guy Ritchie the right director for the King Arthur epic?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With The Sword in the Stone also representing the first novel in White’s eventual four-book saga The Once and Future King, Disney’s revival also offers up the possibility that the studio could adapt the full series. However, the British author took a significantly darker tone in later instalments, and Disney’s live action remake program thus far has rarely strayed from child-friendly material.</p> <p>The Sword in the Stone is just the latest reworking of the studio’s hand-drawn back catalogue. Only last week Hollywood sites reported <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/aladdin-disney-movie-live-action-prequel\">news of a live action prequel to Aladdin</a>, the classic 1992 animation best known for the late Robin Williams’s exuberant voice work as the famed genie of the lamp. And in May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/22/reese-witherspoon-to-play-tinker-bell-in-disney-live-action-fairytale\">reports surfaced of a revisionist live-action film about Peter Pan fairy Tinker Bell</a> starring Reese Witherspoon.</p> <p>Live action takes on Mulan, Pinocchio and Beauty and the Beast (with Emma Watson as Belle) are also on Disney’s slate, and the studio previously found box office success with Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland (2010), Angelina Jolie vehicle Maleficent (2014) and Kenneth Branagh’s Cinderella earlier this year.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"New version of whimsical animation about Merlin’s training of the young King Arthur reportedly joining Tinker Bell and Beauty and the Beast reworkings on studio’s slate","headline":"Disney plans live-action remake of The Sword in the Stone","byline":"Ben Child","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4apvk","wordcount":"499","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/21/1437467778707/8084336e-5374-4174-9458-3c8f506f87f4-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-24T09:00:00+01:00","standfirst":"<p>New version of whimsical animation about Merlin’s training of the young King Arthur reportedly joining Tinker Bell and Beauty and the Beast reworkings on studio’s slate</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/21/disney-live-action-remake-the-sword-in-the-stone","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/jul/21/disney-live-action-remake-the-sword-in-the-stone","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/walt-disney-company","webTitle":"Walt Disney Company","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/walt-disney-company","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/walt-disney-company","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/19/1426761348767/Ben-Child.jpg","firstName":"ben","lastName":"child","twitterHandle":"BenChildGeek","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a Guardian film writer and the blogger behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/week-in-geek\">The Week in Geek</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}]},{"type":"article","sectionId":"film","webTitle":"Cate Blanchett to direct Australian TV drama, Stateless, based on Cornelia Rau","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-21T08:46:42Z","elements":[{"id":"2ce9dd47dd8d61d5e0b49814df9345405babfc20","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/2ce9dd47dd8d61d5e0b49814df9345405babfc20/0_0_5136_3082/2000.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ce9dd47dd8d61d5e0b49814df9345405babfc20/0_0_5136_3082/2000.jpg","source":"AAP","photographer":"Jane Dempster","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Actress Cate Blanchett at the Australian premiere of Disney’s “Cinderella” at the State Theatre in Sydney, March 15, 2015.

Eden doesn’t last very long. It takes place during a heady party in the home of Thomas Bangalter’s parents. We are in the sitting room of the packed apartment, watching Bangalter and his partner Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo preparing to play music as Daft Punk for the first time. We hear the pair whisper to each other, watch them drum their fingers nervously, adjust the levels on the mixer again and again. Then, finally, the needle is placed on a platter of vinyl. The opening bars of Da Funk blast out, a song that would go on to be played countless times across the world. This small party goes wild but, as the track plays, the camera pulls away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/apr/29/mia-hansen-love-french-director\">Mia Hansen-Løve: the broken heart that made me a film-maker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I love the idea of this distance,” says Hansen-Løve, describing how she composed the scene. We are talking early one Sunday morning in a small office at the top of her home in Paris’s Marais district. Behind her desk sits an enormous box filled with drafts of the script for Eden, an intensive, troubled project that took three years and two producers to complete. “In the profile shot, Bangalter and Homem-Christo still belong to the group,” she says. “Then, from the far shot, we see them face on but suddenly they are somewhere else. We have lost them. They are here, but you don’t hear what they say any more because they are stars. I love how we captured that moment.”</p> <p>Bangalter and Homem-Christo are not the heroes of Eden. The characters pop up two or three times, usually in the queue to a nightclub, too cool to say “Do you know who we are?” to unyielding doormen. Neither is Eden is a chronicle of the wildly influential “French touch” scene that produced Daft Punk, Justice, Cassius and Etienne de Crécy, though it is full of that music. It is, however, a beautiful, elegaic film that captures wonderfully the camaraderie and euphoria of club culture – but also its ephemeral nature and habit of leaving people with a nasty hangover.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l1T9xs-o0o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2l1T9xs-o0o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The story follows the life of Paul Vallée (played by Félix de Givry), a DJ, hedonist and lost soul. Like his friends in Daft Punk he shares in the rise of French touch, but unlike the Get Lucky duo, his success is fleeting. Paul is based closely on Sven Hansen-Løve, Mia’s brother and former DJ, who co-wrote the film with her. “It was so exciting for the both of us,” says Hansen-Løve of the project, “just being aware that there was no film that really took [club culture] seriously. There were films that used house music here and there, scenes set in clubs, but not a film about a DJ. Ours would be a film that would show the euphoria of it but also the reality.”</p> <p>So we watch as Paul goes from playing raves in abandoned buildings in the banlieues to MoMA in New York. We watch him stay up all night with his pals and his lovers, joking, drinking and, as this is France, debating the political subtext of Paul Verhoeven’s Showgirls. But we also watch him become dependent on cocaine, lose both friends and lovers, and most poignantly of all, we watch time overtake him before he has even stopped to think what he wants from life.</p> <p>“The first part of the film is really about the power of being with a group of friends,” says Hansen-Løve. “The warmth of that and the feeling of strength and communion and joy that is connected to being part of a group. At some point, though, [Paul] gets stuck in his habits and is not able to move on any more. The fashion changes and he stays stuck in his own little area. He loses his energy and his passion because he has lost his self-esteem. There is this idea of the risk of ending up being alone or losing your way. In the opening scene, Paul is trying to leave a party but can’t find his way out. [The theme of] losing your way is there from the very first moment.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1b6c80644b79cc81b70e39e652951d9d4452232\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/16/1437060355543/bfed0570-6c10-40b3-90de-4391a9915c8d-460x447.jpeg\" alt=\"Mia Hansen Love\" width=\"460\" height=\"447\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dancing queen: Mia Hansen-Løve on the set of Eden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Broad Green Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hansen-Løve says Sven was able to watch the film “coldly” while it was being made. “He was so much part of it, it was like an extension of himself,” she says. When the film was released, however, and critics started to describe Paul’s character as something of a loser, Sven took the criticisms to heart. “It was as if it was the first time he realised the film was independent of him,” she says. “It became real and it gave him a very violent image of himself. I know that was kind of painful.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/12/spotlight-on-the-french-touch-eden-mia-hansen-love-house-music\">Spotlight on... the French touch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film-maker speaks about this outcome dispassionately. The 34-year-old is a thoughtful interviewee, even at this early hour. Dressed in what might well be her pyjamas, a loose grey T-shirt and baggy trousers with birds printed on them, she seems tired, but maybe that’s just the effect of talking in a second language about something in which you’ve invested a lot of yourself. In truth, she has always mined sensitive biographical material for her work. The third of her four features, 2012’s Goodbye First Love, explored her own doomed adolescent passion with an unsparing eye. In it, the heroine, Camille, sought her independence but was unable to resist her physical attraction to a boy who only ever treated her badly.</p> <p>She says attraction also informed how she wrote Eden’s gang of male characters. “You understand people that you are attracted to, maybe not understand but you can capture it as a film-maker. These guys, they have a reluctance to speak. They don’t want to go out and talk for hours in a cafe about their feelings. This coldness is something erotic, somehow.”</p> <p>When I first saw Eden at last year’s Toronto international film festival, most north Americans I spoke to found Eden baffling – and not just because they had never got off their nuts in a sweaty basement. The dialogue is naturalistic; terse and unexpressive. The plot meanders and is unusually paced. The film is also broken into two parts, the second of which seems almost to tell a different story. Originally Hansen-Løve had even hoped to release Eden as two separate films. “It was my Kill Bill,” she laughs. “I think a lot of criticism I got, and part of the reason the film proved so difficult to finance, was that it was long but its length wasn’t justified by… you know, big dramatic things. Instead, it was soft and light.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy1YDMBNfdU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PLWpYcX6lNSTSsalLLG1xxtloFccF2yqV6\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Ultimately, the softness is what makes Eden work. It’s apparent in the way it looks – the light of the setting sun and the breaking dawn – but also in the way it refrains from judging its protagonists. The second part of the story is set after the party is over, when garage music is the most unfashionable thing in town and Paul is no longer a young buck but a man approaching middle age alone. Hansen-Løve, however, sees this as a hopeful outcome.</p> <p>“My favourite image of Paul is the final one,” she says (it’s in keeping with the nature of the film that the following information doesn’t really act as a spoiler). “It’s the very last shot of him where he is lying on his bed. I like it because it’s the very first time you see him alone, not with a girlfriend or any of the boys. I realised while I was filming it that the film had been leading there, to this possibility of being on your own and being somehow free. Before that, being alone was something to be scared of.

gangster was quite a departure for me. I’d mostly played upper-class types. But I’d hung out with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jun/30/4\">Donald Cammell</a>, who wrote the screenplay and co-directed, and I think he’d seen a side of me that said: “James is a raving nutcase, so let’s steer him in the direction of the East End and see what happens.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/02/actor-james-fox\">James Fox: 'I didn't take that much acid'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And it worked: I fell in love with my character, Chas Devlin, a south London gangster. I prepared for the role very seriously, even visiting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/apr/30/legend-trailer-film-tom-hardy-ronnie-reggie-kray\">Ronnie Kray</a> in Brixton prison. The meeting was quite formal, though – what we really needed was to talk to people on the outside. Much more useful, to perfect the manner and accent, were my visits to the <a href=\"http://www.thomasabecket.com/\">Thomas A Becket pub</a> on Old Kent Road with Johnny Shannon, who played gang boss Harry Flowers. John Bindon, who once dated Christine Keeler and had a role as a violent mobster, also had underworld connections.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/10/nicolas-roeg\">Nic Roeg</a> was the other director, and it was his first film. He had a wealth of experience as a cameraman, and I thought the Notting Hill basement scene – in which Chas tries to ingratiate himself with the reclusive rock star played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/mick-jagger\">Mick Jagger</a> – was especially well shot. I already knew Mick and counted him as a friend, but he didn’t take acting very seriously, so you were working against that. </p> <p>I think he and Anita Pallenberg, who had a big role, were entering a relationship at this time and, as I was basically playing the straight guy and sticking to the script, they liked to use this to shock me. But it was a wonderful film to make, way ahead of its time in terms of gender and identity, offering glimpses into the worlds of rock stars and criminals that were much talked about then but little understood.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFxfn3LakeM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFxfn3LakeM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>‘This is a film about madness … and sanity’: watch the original uncut 1970 trailer for Performance – video</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Sandy Lieberson, producer</h2> <p>I’d been an agent for the likes of Peter Sellers, Richard Harris and Sergio Leone, but by 1968 I wanted to make the leap into production. Performance was my first film. Donald Cammell originally envisaged Marlon Brando in the Chas Devlin part, but that was always a bit of a fantasy. We were pretty sure James Fox could pull it off, having seen him in films like The Servant. </p> <p>Mick Jagger was on board from the start, and he brought to the role all the fame and notoriety that was attached to his own name at that time. We wanted to exploit his unusualness, the androgynous sexual aura that hung around him – something that’s harder to appreciate now that he’s a grandfather and such a figure of the establishment. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce9c73dd9788ea919e45b69b1a1767da264e5abb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/20/1437388306481/54170579-d7ce-4dd5-944e-a55963dd20c6-292x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The 1970 poster of Performance\" width=\"292\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We didn’t use a studio; everything was done on location. The betting shop scenes were shot on the New Kings Road, and our technical adviser, David Litvinoff, turned out to be a crucial conduit to the whole East-End criminal scene, having been Ronnie Kray’s lover. He arranged for James to visit Ronnie Kray in jail.</p> <p>We ended up with a non-linear plot because, when I took the rushes to Warner Bros, they hated it. They didn’t think it was releasable, and they sat on it for about nine months. Nic had gone off to make <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/11/walkabout-rewatched-a-wilderness-of-the-mind-as-much-as-of-the-land\">Walkabout</a>, so Donald had to go out there to work on a recut, which introduced the Jagger character earlier, while also toning down the violence and the insinuation of homosexuality, even though it was never graphic. </p> <p>The movie premiered in Los Angeles, and it was a total disaster. The ratings board originally gave it an X certificate, at a time when major movie companies had a pact not to distribute X-rated films. For a while, my career was in the toilet. I can’t recall if, as has been said, a Warner executive’s wife vomited at a screening – but somebody did throw up at one in Santa Monica and they stopped the show. I felt like I’d gone from being a fairly successful agent to a failed producer, but after that I started producing with David Puttnam, going on to make That’ll Be the Day.</p> <p>Performance eventually found a small audience in the US, but it was never a commercial success. Only later did it build a reputation. It was a product of its era: back then, you could make an unusual movie without worrying about things like revenue projection. It was a more impulsive, chance-taking time. <br /></p> <p>• Performance is screening at the <a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=ED05A818-E394-4882-8D4D-BA7C3C76A29B&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=29E5195B-2760-4A4C-8002-F4207ADBA57A\">BFI Southbank</a>, London, 28 and 30 July.

Oscar-winning actor Emma Thompson has spoken out about ageism and the lack of opportunities for women in the acting industry, saying “sexism and unpleasantness” was worse than ever.</p> <p>The Sense

television and film, following comments by stars including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Helen Mirren and director Jane Campion.</p> <p>“I don’t think there’s any appreciable improvement and I think that, for women, the question of how they are supposed to look is worse than it was even when I was young,” she told the new issue of Radio Times. “So, no, I am not impressed, at all. I think it’s still completely shit, actually.”</p> <p>Thompson said: “When I was younger I really did think we were on our way to a better world and when I look at it now, it is in a worse state than I have known it, particularly for women and I find that very disturbing and sad.</p> <p>“So I get behind as many young female performers as I can and actually a lot of the conversations with them are about exactly the fact that we are facing and writing about the same things and nothing has changed, and that some forms of sexism and unpleasantness to women have become more entrenched and indeed more prevalent.”</p> <p>Thompson, 56, plays a 77-year-old prostitute in her latest project, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/17/the-legend-of-barney-thomson-review-robert-carlyle-emma-thompson-glasgow-sweeney-todd\">The Legend of Barney Thomson</a>, opposite co-star Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty) who is also the film’s director.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/21/maggie-gyllenhaal-too-old-hollywood\">Maggie Gyllenhaal: At 37 I was 'too old' for role opposite 55-year-old man</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It is a bit ageist,” said Thomson. “It would be really nice to get someone who is actually 77 to play her, but it’s a wildly comic role and I couldn’t resist.”</p> <p>It is not the first time Thompson, who won an Oscar for her 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, has addressed the issue. </p> <p>Publicising her Disney film Saving Mr Banks two years ago, she said there was a period in her 30s when she was offered “a whole string of roles that basically involved saying to a man: ‘Please don’t go and do that brave thing. Don’t! No, no, no!’</p> <p>“That’s a trope, the stock woman who says: ‘Don’t do the brave thing.’ I said no to all of them. I’m so proud.” She added: “What the ding-dong heck is going on if this is still something we’re talking about?”</p> <p>Gyllenhaal, star of BBC2 drama The Honourable Woman, said earlier this year that she was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/21/maggie-gyllenhaal-too-old-hollywood\">told by a Hollywood producer that she was too old</a>, at 37, to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man.</p> <p>“It was astonishing to me,” she said. “It made me feel bad, and then it made me feel angry, and then it made me laugh.”</p> <p>Her comments prompted research which showed that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/02/average-age-gap-between-malefemale-romantic-movie-leads-is-only-four-years\"> female leads in Hollywood movies were on average four and a half years younger</a> than their male counterparts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/17/helen-mirren-ageism-hollywood-women\">Helen Mirren: ageism in Hollywood is 'outrageous'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prime Suspect star Helen Mirren said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/17/helen-mirren-ageism-hollywood-women\">sexism and ageism against older female actors in the film industry was “fucking outrageous”</a>. Responding to Gyllenhaal’s comments in June, Mirren said: “It’s ridiculous, and twas ever thus.</p> <p>“We all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger. It’s so annoying.”</p> <p>Jane Campion, director of The Piano and BBC2’s Elisabeth Moss drama Top of the Lake, last year said there was “inherent sexism” in the film industry. </p> <p>“It’s not that I resent the male film-making, but there is something that women are doing that we don’t get to know enough about,” she said.</p> <p>Thompson said she would take her 15-year-old daughter, Gaia, to this summer’s Edinburgh festival for the first time to watch a couple of her friends, Lily Bevan and Jessica Butcher, perform one-woman shows.</p> <p>“It means a lot to me because that is what I did and I want my daughter to have a look at that and say: ‘Oh, that’s one way of expressing what you need to express’,” she told the listings magazine.</p> <p>“I think she looks around at the prevailing culture and thinks: ‘None of that really applies to me and I don’t get it’ – the magazines, the ‘figure’ culture and the handbags – it’s just absolutely meaningless. So I can’t wait for her to see these women writer/performers.”</p> <p>The BBC Trust, in the corporation’s annual report last week, said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/14/bbc-put-women-ethnic-minorities-on-screen-trust-tony-hall\">BBC had to do more to put more women on television</a>, as well as tackle a lack of black, Asian and minority ethnic actors on-screen. </p> <p>It was followed by the government’s green paper on the future of the BBC two days later, which also said it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/16/bbc-green-paper-the-key-points\">had to do more to reflect the makeup</a> of its audience.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Oscar-winning actor says sexism and ‘forms of unpleasantness to women have become more entrenched and more prevalent’","headline":"Emma Thompson: sexism in acting industry is worse than ever","byline":"John Plunkett","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4azgk","wordcount":"822","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/458a24e4bc256b48be056023caaf5b6e31d2942c/533_0_1844_1107/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-23T23:01:05Z","standfirst":"<p>Oscar-winning actor says sexism and ‘forms of unpleasantness to women have become more entrenched and more prevalent’</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/21/emma-thompson-sexism-in-acting-industry-is-worse-than-ever","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/jul/21/emma-thompson-sexism-in-acting-industry-is-worse-than-ever","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/emma-thompson","webTitle":"Emma Thompson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-thompson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/emma-thompson","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gender","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gender","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"society/equality","webTitle":"Equality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/equality","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/equality","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"stage/theatre","webTitle":"Theatre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatre","sectionName":"Stage","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","sectionName":"Stage","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/johnplunkett","webTitle":"John Plunkett","r2ContributorId":"15874","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/2/1399058745440/John-Plunkett.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/2/1399058779148/John-Plunkett-R.png","firstName":"","lastName":"plunkett","twitterHandle":"johnplunkett149","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>John Plunkett writes about radio, among many other things, for the Media Guardian and presents the weekly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/series/mediatalk\">Media Talk podcast</a>.

Prison Experiment is one of the summer’s more grim offerings, but that didn’t stop audiences in New York and Los Angeles from flocking to it this past weekend. Its select opening performed “better than expected”, according to <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/arthouse-audit-mr-holmes-starring-ian-mckellen-beats-holdover-hit-love-mercy-20150719\">Thompson on Hollywood</a>, proving that people are still fascinated by the infamous 1971 study conducted at Stanford University that demonstrated the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/15/fact-based-thriller-the-stanford-prison-experiment-unshackles-trailer\">Fact-based thriller The Stanford Prison Experiment unshackles trailer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kyle Patrick Alvarez’s drama dutifully recreates the experiment, led by psychology professor Philip G Zimbardo (played by Billy Crudup in the film), that saw 24 male students (selected from a pool of 75) randomly assigned to the roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. The study occurred during the summer of 1971, when school was not in session. As the film makes uncomfortably clear, what transpired over the course of the experiment was shocking, with some of the guards subjecting prisoners to psychological torture. The grueling experience caused two students to exit the study early. </p> <p>As Zimbardo said during a talk for the film hosted at <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/meet-the-filmmaker/id301899522?mt=2\">the Apple Store in Soho, New York</a> last week: “The sad conclusion [from the experiment] is humanity lost - the evil won.” </p> <p>“That should be the tagline for the movie,” Alvarez joked. </p> <p>As the director confirmed during the discussion, this marks the first time the actual experiment has been turned into a narrative film. Much of the dialogue from inside the mock prison, attributed to Tim Talbott’s screenplay, was lifted directly from typescripts Zimbardo made from over 12 hours of video-recorded study footage. “The movie is a faithful recreation of the essential features of the study,” Zimbardo confirmed. “I’d say 90% is right on.”<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/30/sundance-2015-review-the-stanford-prison-experiment\">Sundance 2015 review – The Stanford Prison Experiment: notorious behaviour test becomes masterful film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the painstaking attention to detail came fear from Alvarez’s cast of potentially going too far down the rabbit hole to bring the Zimbargo’s experiment to the screen. As actor Ezra Miller confirmed during the panel: “There was an inherent danger that we were all aware of, in terms of simulating a simulation and maybe falling into that MC Escher painting, and probably getting stuck there. I think to Kyle’s credit, we were all vetted. I think there were some background checks.”</p> <p>“We cast people who knew they had to put themselves into a place when the camera was rolling, but when they weren’t rolling, it was actually a pretty enjoyable set,” Alvarez added. “People were having a good time.”</p> <p>Said Miller: “We were able to plunge deeper than we would have if we were all in our attempted actual ‘pain bodies’. We were able to jam.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LviGTHud5w\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LviGTHud5w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Zimbargo revealed that had the project landed in different hands, the shoot could have gone very differently. Before Alvarez came on board, another director was being considered, one whose idea it was to “create real antagonism” on and off set, according to Zimbargo. The director allegedly pitched to have the cast live in Regina, Canada, where the actors playing the prisoners were to stay at the city’s worst hotel – with the actors playing the guards sleeping in the best. “[The director] wanted them to hate each other on set,” Zimbargo said. “What he was really hoping for was to recreate some of the emotional breakdowns in the prison – in reality.”</p> <p>Alvarez took the opposite approach, explaining: “I don’t have that in me. I don’t want to be confrontational. I love what actors do so much, that I want to honour that instead.”</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The actor spoke about the grueling experience of making the first film about the infamous 1971 psychological study: ‘I think there were some background checks’","headline":"Ezra Miller: simulating Stanford Prison Experiment carried risk of going too far","byline":"Nigel M Smith","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4azfn","wordcount":"605","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/20/1437404296327/6144e21f-1747-40de-8972-88d9572370eb-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-23T17:45:00-04:00","standfirst":"<p>The actor spoke about the grueling experience of making the first film about the infamous 1971 psychological study: ‘I think there were some background checks’</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/20/ezra-miller-standford-prison-experiment-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/jul/20/ezra-miller-standford-prison-experiment-film","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/sundancefilmfestival","webTitle":"Sundance film festival","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sundancefilmfestival","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/sundancefilmfestival","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nigel-m-smith","webTitle":"Nigel M Smith","r2ContributorId":"70661","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436214332973/Nigel-M-Smith.jpg","firstName":"msmith","lastName":"nigel","twitterHandle":"nigelmfs","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nigel M Smith the Guardian's entertainment writer, based in Los Angeles.

The latter looks to have taken India’s No 1 spot this week, with an impressive 102.6 crore ($16.1m) domestic take and at least $2.5m in overseas readies that would put it just inside the global top 10.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nwAra0mz_Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nwAra0mz_Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Featuring the actor in do-gooder mode as a former wrestler pinning the Kashmir conflict by helping a mute six-year-old Pakistani girl back across the border, the film continues Khan’s domination of India’s Eid box-office window; possibly of little solace to the actor, whose appeal over a five-year sentence for the hit-and-run killing of a homeless man <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/08/salman-khan-bollywood-star-jail-term-suspended-reports\">is still pending</a>. SS Rajamouli’s mighty <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NQRhE772b0\">Baahubali</a>, meanwhile, is striding somewhere between 300 and 335 crore ($47.1-52.6m) worldwide at time of writing, depending on which source you trust. That makes it the most successful Telugu film of all time by a long way, the fastest Indian film over 300 crore, and on current standing, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_Indian_films\">the ninth highest grossing Indian film of all time</a>. The film’s technical prowess, dramatic dynamism and financial heft (the Hindi-language version alone has taken over 50 crore) are prompting some soul-searching within Bollywood – too heavily in hock to its bloated star system, according to some.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/19/bajrangi-bhaijaan-review-salman-khan-india-pakistan-movie\">Bajrangi Bhaijaan review: Salman Khan strong even when wet as he escorts mute six-year-old back to Pakistan</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The winner</h2> <p>Evil – the yellow, burbling sort – edged out the superhero delegation this week, as Minions held on to the top spot despite the incursion of Marvel’s Ant-Man. No particular surprise, with the Universal film on release in nearly 20 more territories. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-be5aee78-d9cf-4970-b76d-a10e904b599f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/20/1437410987178/7f0bdf64-f6f1-47c9-ada7-cc6ce04432c4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Minions \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holding on ... Minions</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only new observation to make is that, with a steep 57% drop from last week’s $115.7m (£74m) US opening, the mindless Minions torrent may not quite have the same staying power as the more homily-rooted Despicable Me (-42% second week drop) or Despicable Me 2 (-47%). If that plummet continues, the latter’s $368.1m US gross (which made it No 4 film in 2013) will be tough to match, and Minions will be left leaning on its (hitherto powerhouse) international performance to make up the slack. A month in, it’s already on $625.8m, with another eight territories and a possible Chinese release to come. So $1bn overall is still on the cards.<br /></p> <h2>Minor Marvel</h2> <p>Ant-Man’s going to do OK for its size. The diminutive hero chosen by Marvel to close business on its <a href=\"http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Phase_Two\">second phase</a> has been given a scaled-down budget: $130m, against Captain America: The First Avenger’s $140m, Thor’s $150m and Guardians of the Galaxy’s $170m, to compare it to the studio’s other first-instalment offerings. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/paul-rudd-ant-man-hollywoods-nice-guy-english-parents-kansas\">Paul Rudd on Ant-Man, being Hollywood’s go-to nice guy and growing up with English parents in Kansas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as well, because Ant-Man’s $58m US opening – good, but still the lowest for an in-house Marvel offering – suggests Peyton Reed’s serviceable, intermittently inspired romp will not have the same level of impact as the rest of the stable. But this was probably a project with innate limitations: Ant-Man is a relatively obscure part of the Marvel canon, and lead actor Paul Rudd supplied only modest star traction ($19.2m for Role Models and $17.8m for I Love You, Man are his <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=paulrudd.htm\">two previous best opening</a>s where he was a key part of the package). <br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/jul/16/ant-man-video-review\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4am5d\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2338780\"            data-video-name=\"Ant-Man - video review\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/16/1437058896714/KP_356906_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457517762\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/16/1437058892986/KP_356906_crop_1200x720.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man.m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Ant-Man - video review</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The good news – for the strength of the overall Marvel brand as much as anything else – is that Ant-Man is going toe-to-toe with other superhero new boys overseas. Taking this week’s top five markets – the UK ($6m), Mexico ($5.6m), Russia ($4.9m), France ($4m) and Australia ($4m) – as comparison points, Ant-Man is outpacing the first Captain America, level with Iron Man, slightly under Thor, well under Guardians of the Galaxy. </p> <p>Interestingly, the one region where it’s setting records next to the above is south-east Asia; possibly Marvel’s heritage, and its superhero pecking order, are less relevant here. So, overall, no danger of Ant-Man’s box office going sub-atomic. Marvel’s <a href=\"http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Phase_Three\">Phase Three</a>, which begins with 2016’s Doctor Strange, could be where the pressure is on: lots of unfamiliar faces to introduce to audiences, and more concerted competition as Warner Bros and DC finally get their act together with their own cinematic universe.<br /></p> <h2>Monster Chinese weekend</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYB7L6YTySs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TYB7L6YTySs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Like February’s news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/mar/04/will-smith-fifty-shades-of-grey-focus-birdman-from-vegas-to-macau-2\">the monthly Chinese total had beaten the US one for the first time</a>, this felt like another one of those weeks where the eastern box-office tide lapped another few centimetres further up the strand. Two local films – CGI/live-action hybrid <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYB7L6YTySs\">Monster Hunt</a> ($72m) and superhero spoof <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj-gZdPLIgQ\">Jian Bing Man</a> ($61m) – each grossed more than the No 1 US film Ant-Man, and helped set a slew of records on the way. Counted across four days since its Thursday release, Monster Hunt – Shrek the Third co-director <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_Hui\">Raman Hui</a>’s tale of a civil war in the monster kingdom – took $109m, beating road comedy Breakup Buddies’ domestic-film opening record from last year; it also set new highs for biggest opening day ($26.4m) and biggest single day ($29.8m). </p> <p>Saturday saw the biggest-ever 24 hours at the Chinese box office ($68.3m), as part of its biggest-ever weekend ($185m), during its biggest-ever week ($282m). Jian Bing Man – which translates as Pancake Man, one of the gallery of goons in this meta-tinged superhero lampooning – is also in line to claim college drama So Young’s benchmark $118m gross for the most successful film for a first-time director. The Chinese Norris McWhirter presumably can’t keep up.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZUHRNqcND8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUHRNqcND8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It comes as a huge boon for Chinese cinema: a sincere vote of confidence from local audiences who, during the late June/July blackout period for Hollywood films designed to artificially boost Chinese market share, have little choice but to gravitate back towards the homemade. But not with wild enthusiasm in the last few weeks. The successes of the last fortnight, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/13/global-box-office-baahubali-minions-mad-max-fury-road\">performing-school drama Forever Young and Shanghai romancer Tiny Times 4.0</a>, were run-of-the-mill entries from the school of contemporary twentysomething fodder that has dominated in recent years. But Monster Hunt – a pricey $35m affair from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon producer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0465067/reference\">Bill Kong</a> that is one of the country’s first CGI/live action combos – and Jian Bing Man – which lets online comedy-sketch sensation Da Peng loose on the superhero trend and ropes in a Jean-Claude van Damme cameo – seem even more commercially aggressive. They’re direct hacks of Hollywood forms that feel far more culturally attuned than the fusty period dramas and lavish but sometimes cloying martial-arts fantasias that have made up so much recent Chinese popular cinema. It’s the government that tends to back those, but as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/uniqlo-sex-video-film-shot-in-beijing-store-goes-viral-and-angers-government\">the Uniqlo scandal</a> shows, its attitudes and tastes are far removed from the young urban middle-class driving the multiplex boom. Monster Hunt and Jian Bing Man are the latest signs that a change-up in top-down cinema development is long overdue.</p> <h2>The future</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFGiHm5WMLk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFGiHm5WMLk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Ant-Man shrinks the kids in 12 more territories, including India, Germany and Spain, while Inside Out – on an emotional rollercoaster of a release schedule that lasts until October, perhaps a mark of how this cerebral title can stand on its own legs in individual territories outside of a simultaneous rollout – comes to the UK. </p> <p>Sony’s Pixels, a rare 21st-century high-concept gig (“80s videogame favourites attack the Earth!’’), is opening wide, though – the studio hoping that retro arcade pleasures and indestructible lower-common-denominator A-lister Adam Sandler are the universal panacea that will speed the film into the most emergent of markets. </p> <p>This week’s 40 territories are weighted heavily towards Latin America and the Middle East. Finding a comparison point for the $110m sci-fi action comedy is a tough one: perhaps 2012’s Wreck-It Ralph, which had a videogame hero but was an animated film; or maybe other concept-driven SFX-driven comedies such as Men in Black and Cowboys &amp; Aliens. </p> <p>Fox, meanwhile, will be hoping lightning strikes twice as they drop <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFGiHm5WMLk\">Paper Towns</a> in 32 territories – it’s another John Green adaptation, the author responsible for The Fault in Our Stars, the young-adult cancer weepie that took a surprising $307.2m for the studio last year. Robot &amp; Frank director Jake Schreier oversees Cara Delevingne – fast leaving behind her rep as gurning LDN model du jour and building an eclectic filmography – as an enigmatic girl-next-door with a yen for revenge.<br /></p> <h2>Top 10 global box office, 17-19 July</h2> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/minions-review-boisterous-and-cheery-despicable-me-spin-off\">Minions</a>, $116.4m from 57 territories. $625.8m cume – 65.4% int; 34.6% US<br />2.

Sync</a>, the two reigning boybands of the late 90s, thought this day would never come. The groups, who once vied for chart dominance, have banded together for an upcoming non-musical collaboration.</p> <p>The bands are partnering with the Asylum, the studio behind the hit SyFy franchise Sharknado, to make what Backstreet member Nick Carter described to <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/backstreet-boys-nsync-will-team-for-zombie-western-asylum-film-20150720\">Rolling Stone</a> as “a zombie western futuristic horror movie”. Carter said he’s slated to play the “good guy that’s going to help save the day”, and will also write the project, tentatively titled Dead 7.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jan/29/why-backstreet-boys-have-little-to-teach-one-direction\">Why the Backstreet Boys have little to teach One Direction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fellow Backstreet members Howie Dorough and AJ McLean and *N Sync’s Joey Fatone have also agreed to star, with McLean playing the film’s main villain. Carter told Rolling Stone that he hopes to cast other musicians in key roles, including <a href=\"http://www.jordanknight.com/\">Jordan Knight</a> from New Kids on the Block. So far, Fatone is the only *N Sync member signed on to the project.</p> <p>The film is the first project to bring Backstreet and *N Sync together. “We’ve never done anything together collectively,” Fatone told Rolling Stone. “People always think [we’re] some sort of rivals. But it’s so funny – there’s never been animosity or anything like that.”</p> <p>Dead 7 marks Carter’s first project as a screenwriter. He has acted before, appearing in the 2004 teen horror film The Hollow, and as himself in the TV movie Monster Island, opposite Carmen Electra.</p> <p>*N Sync’s most successful actor is of course Justin Timberlake, whose filmography includes leading <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/1648913/justin-timberlake-says-the-social-network-will-split-moviegoers/\">roles in the Oscar-winning The Social Network</a> and the Coen Brothers’ Inside Llewyn Davies.

giant fin. The man in the water. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/19/surfer-mick-fanning-battles-shark-attack-at-j-bay-open-im-just-tripping\" title=\"\">It is an image</a> to set pulses racing and make hearts leap out of mouths. In the words of a commentator who had to respond to the live television images of champion surfer Mick Fanning fending off a shark attack during the J-Bay Open in South Africa: “Holy shit … Excuse me.” The live coverage of the contest then cut away presumably to spare viewers the sight of blood spurting from the sea. But Fanning fought off the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/sharks\" title=\"\">shark</a> – apparently you really can deter them with a punch or two – and swam desperately to safety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/19/surfer-mick-fanning-battles-shark-attack-at-j-bay-open-im-just-tripping\">Mick Fanning battles shark attack at surfing competition: 'I'm just tripping'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be great to play the lofty cultural commentator and sneer at people who’d rather watch footage of a surfer being attacked by a shark than pay attention to serious news, but I watched this video several times on Sunday night. It was the only thing that could compete with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jul/20/footage-of-the-queens-nazi-salute-still-fascinates-the-media\" title=\"\">the Queen giving a Nazi salute</a>. Sharks fascinate me, and Fanning’s escape was a mesmerising spectacle.</p> <p>In the brief image when man and shark are clearly seen together in the water, the horror and amazement come solely from the size of that dorsal fin. The sublimity of sharks has a lot to do with our imaginations filling in what we can’t see. Their habit of attacking near the surface with that dark fin sticking out of the water invites us to picture the unseen beast below – doubtless exaggerating its size and ferocity in our minds.</p> <p>It is obviously rare to see an attack like this, filmed live, with the almost corny image of the gliding fin slipping in and out of the water exactly as a film director might seek to stage it. More often, news reports can only show a surfboard with bite marks or a shocked beach crowd.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/jul/20/shark-attack-mick-fanning-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4azvt\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2340108\"            data-video-name=\"Shark attack on surfer Mick Fanning: I punched it a couple of times – video\"            data-video-provider=\"World Surf League/YouTube\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/20/1437353136130/mick-fanning-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457537565\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/20/1437353136130/mick-fanning-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/20/150720FanningInt_FromGAus-1-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/20/150720FanningInt_FromGAus-1_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/20/150720FanningInt_FromGAus-1.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/20/150720FanningInt_FromGAus-1_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/20/150720FanningInt_FromGAus-1/150720FanningInt_FromGAus-1.m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Mick Fanning describes how he fought off a shark as he competed in surfing’s J-Bay open final at Jeffreys Bay, South Africa. Source: World Surf League/YouTube</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But most of all, these shark images are entertaining to look at because we know Fanning survived. He was not even injured. The imagination can quail at his ordeal, while our optimistic human desire for heroes and happy endings delights in his successful flight. “I’m just so stoked,” he admirably said straight after the adventure. It doesn’t sound like he’ll be experiencing post-traumatic stress anytime soon.</p> <p>However much concerned environmentalists (rightly) try to de-sensationalise sharks, there is no escaping the fear and thrill of the knowledge that every time you go in the sea, something out there has the speed, appetite and enormous jaws to eat you. Or in my case, something under the bed. After seeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jaws\" title=\"\">Jaws</a> as a child – I got into the cinema under age – I used to fear sharks were somehow in my bedroom. Castration anxiety? Surely. But sharks also appealed to my sense that there are strange and wonderful things in this world, and they still do.</p> <p>Even before seeing Steven Spielberg’s 1975 film, I was hooked on the nightmare story of a serial killer great white chomping its way through bathers and boats that the movie is based on. A copy of Peter Benchley’s bestselling novel Jaws was passed round at primary school. I learned some proper swearwords from it. I also learned – rightly or wrongly – that sharks are true life monsters, menacing humanity from the depths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>It is all the fault of Steven Spielberg. He recognised something perfect in the meeting of shark and camera and mind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s not hard to see why Jaws made such an impact on my childhood. I lived in a seaside town. It was Amity without the shark. The idea that all that grey-green water on the edge of town harboured not just pollutants from the nearby Mersey, but might also be home to man-eating monsters was a mind-expanding thought. The world is magical and mysterious because it includes these creatures.</p> <p>The only shark I ever saw on that local beach was a dead dogfish about a foot long. And the only shark I have been near in the water was another dogfish (or skate) that flapped past me and my child in the sea off Kent once. On the other hand, we have also swum off Italy’s Ligurian coast where there have been encounters with great white sharks.</p> <p>I know that sort of stuff, you see. Every time I go to a Mediterranean beach, I look up sites like that of <a href=\"http://www.sharktrust.org/\" title=\"\">The Shark Trust</a>. Why? It is ultimately all the fault of Steven Spielberg. After seeing Jaws it is impossible to go in the sea without your mind creating its own Spielbergian shark scenarios. He recognised something perfect in the meeting of shark and camera and mind.</p> <p>The image of Fanning in the water next to that mesmerising fin proves once again that sharks are magnificently, stupendously cinematic. Now you see them, now you don’t. They inhabit a world few of us will ever explore in depth, another reality below the waves. When they appear out of the blue it is a glimpse of something utterly other and beyond our control. The sea is the unconscious of planet Earth and sharks are the monsters in its green sleep.</p> <p>Encounters with them are marvellous adventures, as Fanning rightly recognised. His amazed description of his experience acknowledged what too few accounts of sharks ever do – that to come close to one is an incredible privilege. Sharks need to be protected so they can go on inhabiting the cinema of the imagination.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The image of Fanning in the water next to that iconic fin proves once again that sharks are the magnificent, cinematic stars of the imagination","headline":"Mick Fanning’s shark escape mesmerised me – just as Jaws once did","byline":"Jonathan Jones","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4azbc","wordcount":"942","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/0461f0d1909ed2af5d2a4ef62d94e2c599e5920a/0_0_2000_1200/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-23T13:03:22Z","standfirst":"The image of Fanning in the water next to that iconic fin proves once again that sharks are the magnificent, cinematic stars of the imagination"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/20/mick-fanning-shark-escape-jaws-fin","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/20/mick-fanning-shark-escape-jaws-fin","sectionName":"Comment is free","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/series/framing-the-debate","webTitle":"Framing the debate","description":"A great photograph doesn't only say more than a thousand words, it can also create a hundred different reactions.

However, it was hit with protests in April when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/23/adam-sandler-ridiculous-six-native-americans-racism\">a group of extras walked off the set</a> after objecting to a series of gags on taste grounds and that the portrayal of Native Americans was inaccurate. Claims also emerged that makeup was being used to make actors’ skin look darker.</p> <p>Sandler also told Screen Crush that The Ridiculous Six is a “pro-Indian movie”. he said: “I talked to some of the actors on the set who were there and let them know that the intention of the movie is 100% to just make a funny movie.”</p> <p> He continued: “It’s really about American Indians being good to my character and […] just being good people.

ribald comic Amy Schumer’s self-penned romantic comedy Trainwreck helped to turn a TV breakout into a full-on movie star over the weekend with a $30.2m US opening, exceeding the expectations of analysts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/trainwreck-review-amy-schumer-romcom-judd-apatow\">Trainwreck review – Amy Schumer's romcom is a mixed platter of crudities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While her show Inside Amy Schumer might have gone viral more times than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_Cat\">Keyboard Cat</a>, it wasn’t solid proof of the comedian’s appeal in the non-digital world. But the star tirelessly promoted the film and herself, whether it was presenting the MTV movie awards, <a href=\"http://time.com/3911899/amy-schumer-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-time-100/\">throwing herself in front of Kim Kardashian</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/20/lucasfilm-topless-amy-schumer-star-wars-shoot-is-inappropriate\">pissing George Lucas off</a>, ensuring a wider awareness of her once niche brand. It was a strategy that meant her first lead role in Trainwreck became director Judd Apatow’s second biggest opener, as well as beating other female-led hits such as Bridesmaids and Spy. But while this is a great result for the undeniably talented Schumer and female comedy in general, it does prove potentially problematic for its star.</p> <p>In the film, Schumer plays an extension of herself, with a similar family dynamic and even possessing the same first name. The film follows “Amy” as a hard-drinking men’s magazine journalist whose fear of commitment is challenged when she falls in love for the first time. While <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/amy-schumer-reveals-trainwreck-autobiographical/story?id=32501068\">she admitted</a> that she doesn’t have “as much sex as her or drink as much”, she still refers to the script as “pretty autobiographical”.</p> <p>Schumer’s brand of humour has always been closely linked to her own sense of self, poking fun at perception, internal and external, with stand up and sketches that see her referencing her own insecurities and the difficulties of succeeding in a vapid, image-obsessed industry. But the problem she now faces is that the comic who forever jokes about never making it is now the actress who has pretty much made it. She’s on the cover of everything from Glamour to GQ and not by playing the bitchy best friend or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL9cV0-SuxY\">dumpy meerkat</a> but the three-dimensional leading lady. It’s the same problem that faces rappers who rhyme about the struggle to get paid who then get paid more than anyone else listening to their record. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/feb/12/trainwreck-trailer-amy-schumer-judd-apatow\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/45mh3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2240679\"            data-video-name=\"Watch the trailer for Amy Schumer and Judd Apatow's buzzed-about comedy Trainwreck – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/2/12/1423740898682/crop_KP_93704_640x360.png\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-455406993\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/2/12/1423740895087/crop_KP_93704_1200x720.png\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/02/12/150212Trainwreck_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/02/12/150212Trainwreck.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/02/12/150212Trainwreck_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10086472&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/02/12/150212Trainwreck_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>   <p>That’s not to say that Schumer’s hit then secures her a spot on the A-list. Firstly, while Trainwreck is already a hit in the US (in the next couple of days it will have made back more than its $35m budget), international success will prove slightly tougher. Trainwreck is a defiantly American film, packed with sports references and pop culture jokes that will fail to translate overseas, even if its overarching themes of commitment phobia and dysfunctional dating will. Her show is also less widely known outside of the US and in an industry which puts more and more pressure on a film’s global haul, she’ll have to work hard to ensure her name is known around the world.</p> <p>But what might prove the biggest longterm pitfall for Schumer is the inextricable link between her comic persona and her real self. Much of her success as a comic relies on her ability to be open and unembarrassed about her life. Nothing is off topic for Schumer and it’s this candidness that makes her so disarming. But it also makes her vulnerable. We know the real Amy so well, or at least we think we do, and we now know the similarish Trainwreck Amy but can we disassociate any form of Amy from her future roles?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/15/amy-schumer-trainwreck-premiere\">Amy Schumer's Trainwreck gets big laughs at hometown premiere</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s a problem that faces anyone whose comedy intersects with their own personality, especially when they’re known for writing their own jokes. Can we ever imagine Tina Fey as anyone but Liz Lemon? Or Jerry Seinfeld as anyone but Seinfeld? Schumer’s ascent to movie stardom will now bring her a variety of roles from writers attempting to replicate her voice and offering a watered down version of what she does best. Take a look at Fey’s big-screen career which has been problematic because none of the scripts she’s picked have ever matched her talent as a writer (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/15/tina-fey-and-amy-poehler-party-hard-in-new-trailer-for-sisters\">the trailer for Sisters</a> suggests another disappointment after Admission and This Is Where I Leave You). </p> <p>So where next for Schumer? She currently has two projects on her slate and after Trainwreck’s big opening, both will now surely be deemed a high priority. Firstly, there’s comedy Plus One, which will headline Jessica Chastain as a woman out of a long-term relationship using her crude friend Schumer to help her get back on the scene. Secondly, there’s an action comedy, to be produced by Paul Feig, which will see Schumer, who will co-write the script, on a holiday gone wrong with her mother. </p> <p>Allowing Schumer to write her own material, progress as a screenwriter and control her career is, in theory, the more exciting eventuality, especially given her bold take on gender expectations. If she starts to compromise on what roles she takes then it will undermine her cutting dissection of how the industry treats women. No one wants to see Schumer go from bride to bridesmaid, offering trailer-ready one-liners while the spotlight is hogged by someone else.

Ant-Man <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-ant-man-no-809752\">debuted to $58m at the US box office this weekend</a>, the lowest opening for a Marvel film since 2008 but still a respectable total for a movie which has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/16/ant-man-kevin-feige-rejects-marvel-criticism-over-edgar-wright-exit\">had a troubled gestation period</a>.<br /></p> <p>Peyton Reed’s film had been expected to break the $60m mark, but dipped slightly lower. Only 2008’s misfiring The Incredible Hulk fared more weakly with $55.4m, back when the comic book publisher was a relative Hollywood ingenue and did not have the corporate firepower of studio Disney to buoy it.</p> <p>Ant-Man failed to hit the heights of Thor or Captain America: The First Avenger (both $65m in 2011), though its superior performance outside the US should bring it into line with those movies. The film’s struggles began when it lost original director Edgar Wright due to “creative differences” just weeks before it was due to begin shooting. Given all that negative publicity – no previous Marvel film has had to contend with such obstacles – the Disney-owned studio will be delighted with a reported $114.4m global opening on the back of reasonable reviews.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/jul/16/ant-man-video-review\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4am5d\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2338780\"            data-video-name=\"Ant-Man - video review\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/16/1437058896714/KP_356906_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457517762\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/16/1437058892986/KP_356906_crop_1200x720.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/16/GuardianFilmShow_16.07.15_Review01_Ant-Man.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/ant-man-review-paul-rudd-marvel\">Ant-Man review – really, really small superhero slips between the cracks | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ant-Man stars Paul Rudd as the titular size-shifting crimefighter, who is recruited to adopt the mantle of Earth’s tiniest hero by Michael Douglas’s genius inventor Hank Pym. The Hobbit’s Evangeline Lily plays Pym’s daughter, who teaches Rudd how to fight.</p> <p>Second place in the US chart went to last week’s No 1, Minions, which dropped more than 50% but still picked up a hefty $50.2m haul this time around for a two-week total of $216.7m. </p> <p>Third spot went to the Judd Apatow comedy Trainwreck, starring the comic and actor Amy Schumer as a New York magazine journalist with an out-of-control lifestyle. In its first week of release, and with few rivals in the R-rated marketplace, the film scored a healthy $30.2m.</p> <p>The top five was rounded out by enduring blockbusters Inside Out, with another $11.6m in its fifth week for a total of $306.3m, and Jurassic World, with $11.3m for a six-week total of $611.1m.</p> <p>Bill Condon’s Mr Holmes, starring Ian McKellen as a nonagenarian version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s great English sleuth Sherlock Holmes, landed in 10th place with an encouraging $2.4m on debut. The mystery drama co-stars Laura Linney and Milo Parker in the story of a retired Holmes’ struggles with dementia and the resolution of one last, emblematic case.</p> <p>Outside the top 10, Woody Allen’s new film Irrational Man debuted to an impressive screen average of $37,623 (total $188,115) from just five cinemas on limited release. The mystery drama stars Joaquin Phoenix as a philosophy professor experiencing an existential crisis who embarks on a relationship with a student, played by Emma Stone, who takes his classes.</p> <h2>US box office chart, 17-19 July</h2> <p>1.

tricks help breathe new life into art of the death-defying stunt","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-01-17T21:10:34Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>When Ólafur Darri Ólafsson conquers his terror of heights and steps off the roof of a seven-storey building in an apparently suicidal leap into the void, cinema audiences could be forgiven for thinking the chilling sequence was filmed deploying the latest in computer-generated characters. They would be wrong.</p> <p>The scene with the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0959963/awards\">award-winning </a>Icelandic-American actor, which features in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTKBowDjMQg\"><em>A Walk Among the Tombstones,</em> starring Liam Neeson</a>, was made possible because he was attached to a crane, harness and rigging, all of which were then erased from the footage.</p> <p>The equipment had been repeatedly tested, first with heavy bags. Even so, few of us would be likely to attempt it ourselves.</p> <p>Stunt performers are increasingly working with the industry’s visual effects wizards now that more spectacular actions can be performed with safety equipment that can later be blotted out for the audience.</p> <p>Ólafsson’s stunt was organised by Mark Vanselow, a leading stuntman and coordinator, who has worked on 16 films with Neeson, the Oscar-nominated star of <em>Schindler’s List</em>, as well as on Hollywood blockbusters such as <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>.</p> <p>Vanselow said that it is now possible to stage stunts that were previously regarded as impossible, and actors can increasingly perform their own stunts, which makes the action seem more realistic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-298d19ea-dddf-4c86-8007-25c2aa8a27fc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/17/1421538090549/40a65a9f-156f-4a9e-9eae-d095d0bd6904-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sandra Bullock gravity stunt special eddefct\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Bullock in the rig, which was later digitally removed, in Gravity.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only a few years ago, he said, stunt specialists had grimly resigned themselves “to start looking for another job” because they feared that computer effects were becoming so sophisticated. They could not have been more wrong: “It actually helps us,” said Vanselow. “The computer is breathing new life into the profession.”</p> <p>Ólafsson plays a cemetery groundskeeper alongside Neeson’s character, a private investigator hired by a drug-trafficker to find out who murdered his wife.</p> <p>“I’m afraid of heights,” he said. “That was a challenge to overcome.” He credited Vanselow and his team with helping him to face it: “They tested it again and again. Mark was very careful to make sure I wasn’t being pushed.”</p> <p>Everything went into slow motion, he remembers. Just watching that scene is “scary”. Even with the safety equipment, a passerby screamed as he jumped – and can be heard in the film.</p> <p>“That’s a great example of how the special effects help us,” said Vanselow. “The audience gets to see the actual character doing the stunt – and the actor gets to go home at night. It’s not an easy thing to just jump off a building … You put a lot of trust in us.”</p> <p>Vanselow began his career as a water-skier, performing “circus on water” shows worldwide. Being a stuntman means doing “things that are fun”, he said, “like hanging under a helicopter”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a445c666be420655d2b5d5a2aec8d19b6c27c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/17/1421538486637/65e3d30c-07bd-454f-bc68-d89f4339c023-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Vanselow stuntman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Vanselow, a stuntman and stunt co-ordinator who has worked on 16 films with Liam Neeson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another Neeson film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYigQFLZmY\"><em>Seraphim Falls</em></a>, Vanselow went over a 34-metre waterfall, dropped from underneath a helicopter. “That was one of the biggest stunts I’ve done. They dropped me over the edge on a bungee rope and I disappeared into the water and popped back up.</p> <p>“I was able to do it that way because they could [blot out] the line that was holding me, whereas 20 years ago I would have had to go over without a line. They may not have been able to do that stunt at all.”</p> <p>It does, however, remain a dangerous profession. “About 99% of the time, you’re overpaid,” said Vanselow. “But then that 1% … There’s not enough money in the world. If you’re jumping off a building and something goes desperately wrong, you’re the person at the end of the wire.”</p> <p>Tim Webber, the British visual effects specialist who won an Oscar for <em>Gravity</em>, the space disaster film starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, said of Vanselow: “He’s absolutely right, judging from the amount of work we do these days that involves stuntmen, and how much I work with [them to design stunts], I’ve worked closely with stuntmen a lot more, recently.”</p> <p>Basing special effects on real action also makes a film more believable, he said. “Once you create computer-generated characters that can do absolutely anything, it loses any ‘wow factor’.”</p> <p>Vanselow said the technology is now so sophisticated that where a stunt performer has to be used they can superimpose an actor’s face over the stunt specialist’s, allowing full close-up shots.</p> <p>Andrew Lane, author of <em>Movie Stunts &amp; Special Effects</em>, said: “But a performer is always needed to form the basis of visual creations in a computer.”</p> <p><em>A Walk Among the Tombstones is released on Blu-ray and DVD on 19 January</em></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"New era in film puts the stars right back in the big scenes, and enables stunts once considered

the year that black cinema bounced back in America","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-12-25T13:00:10Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>As reports pour in about the shooting of yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2014/dec/24/black-teenager-shot-dead-by-police-in-st-louis-live-updates\">another black teenager in St Louis</a>, I was reminded of what filmmaker Ava DuVernay said a few weeks ago: “This aggression is ambient, it’s all-around, and it’s the atmosphere of people of color in this country”.</p> <p>DuVernay said these words while promoting her latest film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6t7vVTxaic\">Selma</a>, which opens tomorrow. It’s a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/05/selma-review-civil-rights-drama\">gorgeous and brave film</a> that tells the story of the 1965 marches from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/dec/17/1965-selma-montgomery-march-stephen-somerstein\">Selma to Montgomery</a>, led by Dr Martin Luther King Jr.</p> <p>When DuVernay began filming Selma this year, she could not have predicted that in August, a young unarmed black man named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Michael Brown would be shot </a>by police in Ferguson, Missouri. She could not have predicted that a grand jury would decide not to indict police officers in the death of not just Mike Brown, but also in the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>. </p> <p>And yet, Selma lands perfectly in sync with the unrest that has characterized the last few months for black America. By grounding the film in the conversations being had in America in 2014, Selma succeeds in transcending the historical drama cateogory – it’s as contemporary as ever, and as real and familiar as it could be. </p> <p>There’s a scene in the film where Martin Luther King, played by David Oyelowo, speaks to his congregation after a young black man has been shot. His fury rises as he wonders: “how many fingers were on that trigger? Every white preacher who stands silent. Every Negro who stands back.” The conversation about the silence of white Americans about racial injustice is one that is most likely taking place right now, and with nearly the same language.</p> <p>DuVernay isn’t the only black director making brave, forward-thinking cinema. She is among the leaders of a new school of black filmmakers who are creating new contemporary narratives for the black experience. DuVernay made history by becoming the first black woman to be nominated for best director at the Golden Globes; Selma is up for best picture.</p> <p>Also at the forefront of this movement are Justin Simien, the writer and director of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uag2G0J6iqw\">Dear White People</a>; Ryan Coogler, whose 2013 directorial debut, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxUJwJfcQaQ\">Fruitvale Station</a>, took home the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance; Beyond The Lights director Gina Prince-Bythewood, and, of course, British artist-turned-director Steve McQueen, whose third feature film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z02Ie8wKKRg\">12 Years A Slave</a>, won the Oscar for best picture this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b004b3243456235fd9dfcc95313f9bf12b5ac073\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b004b3243456235fd9dfcc95313f9bf12b5ac073/0_51_2712_1627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Oyelowo, center, as Martin Luther King Jr and Carmen Ejogo, right, as Coretta Scott King in Selma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simien’s film satirically explores crises in modern blackness, while Coogler’s Fruitvale Station chronicles the events that led to the death of Oscar Grant, a young black man from Oakland. McQueen’s film, 12 Years A Slave, brought slavery to audiences in brutal realism rarely seen on the screen.</p> <p>These directors are reimagining possibilities not just for black filmmakers, but for new stories to be told about the black experience – and audiences are interested. Fruitvale Station was made for the paltry sum of $900,000 and so far has made more than $17m. Simien described Dear White People’s budget as “real low”, and said that film is approaching $4.5m at the box office. And 12 Years A Slave has banked more than $185m on a $22m budget. With Oscar buzz building around Selma, it’s easy to imagine the film being equally successful.</p> <p>The encouraging reaction has spurred interest from studios in making more black films. McQueen has announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/18/steve-mcqueen-to-make-film-about-paul-robeson\">his next project will be about the singer Paul Robeson</a>, the civil rights activist, singer and actor. Meanwhile, Coogler’s <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-followup-creed-building-cast-shoot-dates-eyed-20141111\">next film will be entitled Creed,</a> and is a spinoff of the Rocky films centering on the grandson of Apollo Creed, the black boxer whom Rocky beats to become champion. </p> <p>These filmmakers are making markedly different films than the projects Hollywood was interested in just 5 years ago. Only Lee Daniels’ Precious warranted any attention from the Oscars. That film received a great deal of criticism for telling a one-dimensional story of the black experience: poor, downtrodden and gratuitously hopeless. It’s a story that targets a specific audience. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/17/AR2009111703465.html?nav=rss_email/components&amp;sid=ST2009111703607\">Courtland Milloy criticized</a> the exaggerated story of black life portrayed in Precious: “When human pathology is given a black face, white people don’t have to feel so bad about their own.”</p> <p>Fast forward to 2014 and one of the year’s most significant releases is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/top-five-review-chris-rock-toronto-movie\">Chris Rock’s comedy Top Five</a>. The central theme of that film is the rejection of singular, dominant narratives. Chris Rock’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/17/chris-rock-the-top-five-moments-from-his-top-five-promo-tour\">promotion of the film</a>, has sparked interesting conversations about new realities of race and racism in the US. There is a great deal to dissect about race relations today, and grounding these films in the contemporary black experience stands in contrast to films that Hollywood usually hungers for.</p> <p>There was a serious lull in black films about contemporary experience, but with directors such as DuVernay, Simien, Coogler and McQueen, it seems we’ve entered a new and promising era where stories about blackness are told by artists who are as concerned with the storytelling as they are with how their work will resonate with those who have lived the black experience in America.

Try these 10 festive films instead","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-12-23T14:00:05Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>First things first: <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099785/\">Home Alone </a>is the perfect Christmas movie, and if you don’t agree, then you’re wrong, and I’m sorry.</p> <p>That being said, there’s still such a thing as too much McAllister. Too much Harry, too much Marv – and too much reconciling the sad truth that Kevin never ate that delicious-looking plate of macaroni and cheese he prayed to and in front of. (Which is just one of the reasons we know he grew up to be a criminal sociopath.) That’s why we’ve assembled this list of “holiday” movies you can bask in when you need to keep the traditional choices at bay.</p> <p>Sorry, Buzz and friends.</p> <h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/\">Die Hard</a> (1988)</h2> <p>It’s the Christmas movie in which Alan Rickman’s character doesn’t cheat on Emma Thompson. (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/16/how-we-made-love-actually\">Love Actually</a> – never forget.) Instead, Rickman plays a German terrorist named Hans Gruber who takes Bruce Willis (John McClane)’s wife hostage – along with others – at a Christmas party, making this soiree way worse than anything your company has ever thrown. The good news? Bruce Willis’ reputation as an action hero holds up. The better? <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/summer_movies/2007/06/yippeekiyay.html\">“Yippee ki yay, motherfucker.”</a></p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/prometheus\">Prometheus</a> (2012)</h2> <p>No matter what goes down at your family Christmas this year, remember it’s nowhere near as bad as what happens when a team of explorers land on an alien planet on Christmas day, and must subsequently defend the future of mankind as we know it. However, bonus points for a scene in which Idris Elba decorates a small tree alone on the ship. Charlie Brown would be proud.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/silver-linings-playbook\">Silver Linings Playbook</a> (2012)</h2> <p>True, Silver Linings Playbook takes place over the course of a few months, but the catalyst comes at Christmas, when Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) perform at a dance competition at a festively-decorated hotel. (And that’s all I’m going to tell you.)</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/edward-scissorhands-burton-fantasy\">Edward Scissorhands</a> (1990)</h2> <p>Look. Not to spoil a movie you’ve had 24 years to see, but on top of scenes filled with holiday imagery (lights, trees and tinsel), we learn that the reason it snows every Christmas is because Edward (Johnny Depp) once made snow – and an ice sculpture – for the woman he loved (Winona Ryder) to dance in, and kept doing it, even though they couldn’t be together. (No I’m not crying – you’re crying. Don’t look at me.)</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/10/3\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> (1999)</h2> <p>If you’re into traditional holiday films you’ve found the perfect reason not to watch this. Set at Christmas, Kubrick’s tale of marriage and (in)fidelity is accompanied by traditional trees and lights, creating a stark contrast between the beauty of the season and the movie’s dark halls, capes, masks and dead people. (The last scene will also change the way you see Christmas shopping, forever.)</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/08/my-guilty-pleasure-trading-places\">Trading Places </a>(1983)</h2> <p>But enough of the bleak: Trading Places delivers the hilarious cautionary tale of what happens when two greedy, evil bankers opt to ruin a stockbroker’s (Dan Aykroyd) life. Granted, the movie’s not entirely set at Christmas, but we get a scene where Akroyd eats salmon while wearing a Santa suit which, as far as I’m concerned, is the gift that keeps on giving.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433400/\">Just Friends</a> (2005)</h2> <p>Ryan Reynolds represents the best and worst of us as Chris Brander, a guy whose life was miserable in high school, and whose rejection at the hands of best pal Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart) “turned” him into a womanizer in his adult years. Alas, when he comes home for Christmas, disaster ensues – especially since most of us know that our hometowns will never allow us to escape who we once were.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/nov/13/markkermode\">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a> (2005)</h2> <p>Michelle Monaghan’s Christmas ensemble may be one of the only giveaways that this Robert Downey Jr/Val Kilmer vehicle is a holiday film, but that’s why we’re all here anyway, right? Enter: a hugely underrated film noir that sees a thief, actress, private eye and partridge in a pear tree (just kidding) forced to solve a murder-mystery. Just like the Christmas story taught us.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/23/why-i-love-movie-computers\">You’ve Got Mail </a>(1998)</h2> <p>Admittedly, You’ve Got Mail takes place from October to spring, but what matters most is that the movie’s most compelling scenes – when Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) discovers that Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is ShopGirl, when they have coffee, when Kathleen realizes she’s probably going to lose her store (and again, no, not crying) –occur over the Best Time of Year™. This is also the second time Nora Ephron busted out Christmas catalysts: in 1993’s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108160/\">Sleepless in Seattle</a>, Tom Hanks’ Sam Baldwin calls into the radio station for the first time on Christmas, just as Meg Ryan’s Annie Reed tunes in. And that’s why all other Christmas movies – and other movies in general – are garbage.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,558610,00.html\">Batman Returns</a> (1992)</h2> <p>Why does Batman Returns take place at Christmas? Easy: so Batman, Catwoman, the Penguin, and Max can fight under and using various decorations. Because the snow adds a little magic to the bleak Gotham cityscape. Because otherwise we wouldn’t know that mistletoe is poisonous. Also, because this was directed by Tim Burton, and by now we know that the only thing he loves more than Halloween is spooky Christmas. Way better than Bane’s shearling coat of The Dark Knight Rises. (Sorry, Christopher Nolan.) </p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"If you’ve had too much McAllister then there are plenty of other holiday movies to sink into with a glass of port in hand – and we don’t mean Love Actually","headline":"Bored by Home Alone?

Motivation review – an off-kilter look at female soldiers in the IDF","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-12-05T16:32:19Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>If you show a staple gun in the first act it has to go off in the third. But that’s about the only dramatic principle to which the characters in Zero Motivation adhere. Normally that would be a problem, seeing as how this film is set in the army, but it’s not like we’re on the battle lines. Writer-director Talya Lavie drew from her own personal experience in the Israeli Defense Forces, setting her first feature in the dullest administrative office in a remote desert base. The elevator pitch “Girls meets M*A*S*H” may seem a tad reductive, but it’s apt. The angst is the same though the specifics, and urgency, has changed.</p> <p>The Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of Paper and Shredding, Daffi (Nelly Tagar), has devoted her life’s efforts toward one goal: to transfer her compulsory military service to a base in Tel Aviv. Visions of walking amid gleaming towers in high heels are the only thing keeping her alive. This potential abandonment causes some stress for her pal Zohar (Dana Ivgy), a coarse and slightly unkempt fellow secretary/soldier whose sole job, it would seem, is playing Minesweeper on an outdated computer. Zohar is a Yossarian-esque rascal, the only one who can see that everyone else at the base is nuts. If Daffi goes, Zohar will be left alone with the twin ditzes who sing pop songs and twirl their gum, a brusque Russian immigrant who makes fatalist remarks in a voice so low certain dogs couldn’t hear it and the by-the-book commander whose twin passions are paperwork and brown-nosing. It’s a textbook case of an individual mortified by dense authority. If Bill Murray were a twenty-something Israeli woman, he’d be Dana Igvy as the disheveled kibbutznik in Zero Motivation.</p> <p>The bulk of the film plays out in episodic form (indeed, it is segmented in three chapters) but this sitcom-like setup serves a purpose. Characters weave in and out. Someone that seems key will drift away as someone that seemed merely a gag takes center stage for a while. This approach works well to underscore the feeling of a life in which unseen and inexplicable forces are in control. In time, Zohar’s brusk exterior reveals an inner timidity beneath her khaki parka. She’s actually a virgin, likely the only one on the base, and if dating weren’t difficult enough these days try working that out as a new platoon of handsome paratroopers bunk down for just a few nights.</p> <p>The comedy in Zero Motivation ranges from wordplay to visual gags to some “saw that coming down Broadway” moments of comeuppance. There is, however, an undercurrent of sadness, particularly with Rama (Shani Klein) the group leader. Clearly she’s the foil – she keeps a framed photo of Margaret Thatcher on her wall – but it’s not her fault her battalion of paper filers are the Bad News Bears of the Israeli desert, and the way in which the male officers disregard her smacks of unspoken sexism. She’s passed over for a promotion for another woman, but are any men in her position asked to serve coffee?</p> <p>There are no references to Hamas or Palestinians or Arabs or anything else connoting the unending conflict in the Middle East. Yet our bumbling leads are reminded time and again that “we are at war” and “our soldiers are dying”. The only nod to headlines or history is a shot of a woman stapling up posters commemorating Israel’s numerous conflicts from 1948 through to our current decade. The degree to which real danger and bloodshed is ignored in Zero Motivation adds a strange urgency what could otherwise be an Office Space-like lark. When the movie does take some dark turns, it’s almost a relief.</p> <p>There are some whose politics have no room for a film like this. “This is not a laughing matter”, they’ll say. This attitude negates reality, and perhaps negates storytelling in general. Zero Motivation is a shot of honesty, in which short-term goals are far more important than larger geo-political ones.

Aykroyd: ‘My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy. You get on that and you don’t need a shrink’","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-11-22T14:00:06Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p><strong>My very mild Asperger’s </strong>has helped me creatively. I sometimes hear a voice and think: “That could be a character I could do.” Of course there are many different grades, right up to the autism spectrum, and I am nowhere near that. But I sympathise with children who have it.</p> <p><strong>As I’ve grown older </strong>I’ve become less focused on show business. I am no longer writing and pitching scripts. I am much more picky about the movies I do. In the 80s and 90s I was away from my family a lot, so I am trying to make up for that by spending time with them now.</p> <p><strong>I don’t draw inspiration from my childhood. </strong>There are guys like Jim Carrey who had a miserable youth and created incredible comedy from that. But I had a great childhood in Ottawa, Canada.</p> <p><strong>James Brown showed me </strong>the responsibilities of being a band leader, with the rest of your group relying on you to keep the pay cheques coming in. Even if he was feeling down he didn’t let it affect his performance.</p> <p><strong>There is a universal life force that connects us all.</strong> I believe in an overhead cosmic godhead, a power that I draw on. But a church doesn’t have to be a church, it can just be one or more people in a room.</p> <p><strong>The death of John Belushi hit me hard. </strong>We had so much going on: a hit movie, a TV series. Suddenly I lost my partner. For a while afterwards I thought I might not come back from that.</p> <p><strong>Comedians today are more thoughtful than we were,</strong> and more grounded in real life. We did more absurdist stuff. But I love the younger guys – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jonah-hill\">Jonah Hill</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell\">Will Ferrell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy\">Melissa McCarthy</a>. The torch has been passed.</p> <p><strong>I think of myself as a capitalist-socialist. </strong>I’m not very political, but if you had to take my leanings I’m left of centre. After Hurricane Katrina a lot of money was sucked away and never went to the rural police departments. My charity [the <a href=\"http://bluelineusa.org/\">Blue Line Foundation</a>] provides equipment and training – if you provide a car or a vest, you are tangibly making a difference.</p> <p><strong>My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy. </strong>You get on that and you don’t need a shrink. When you’re on the bike all you’re doing is concentrating on staying alive. You get into the rhythm of the road and it’s quite zen.</p> <p><strong>I’m a big fan of the British monarchy.</strong> I am lucky to have met the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward – they’re a living link with history. I look at Prince William and see a young guy with his heart and soul in the right place.</p> <p><strong>I believe in the continuous consciousness of the soul: </strong>when you die it goes off on a journey and becomes something else.

The high level of discord, he suggests, has provided him with dramatic material ever since.</p> <p>Leigh, 71, tells Yentob that his father, Dr Abe Leigh, was deeply opposed to the idea that he might become an artist or an actor. He forbade him his frequent habit of sketching visitors to the house and regarded him as a problem child because of his creative interests.</p> <p>“I was always drawing caricatures of people and he asked me to stop because he thought it might offend them,” Leigh will say. “Even the word ‘artist’ was very frightening to him, anathema. So the idea that I would be any sort of artist was terrifying to him”</p> <p>At the age of 14 Leigh was taken to see an NHS psychiatrist. “He [his father] decided I had something wrong with me mentally. So I went to see this extremely nice guy. And these were the first adult conversations I had had with another adult.”</p> <p>The psychiatrist told Leigh’s father that there was no mental problem with his son, but the news was not welcomed. “He said, ‘There is nothing wrong with him. He just doesn’t like being at home.’ My father was very angry and stopped me going. So I used to go along on my own to see him, and when my father found out about that he threatened to have him struck off the register.”</p> <p>The film director also recalls that both his parents were concerned about social appearances and about doing “the done thing”. The family moved from a working-class area of Salford out into the suburbs and their desire to conform became the centre of conflict. “I remember life at home becoming a battlefield every night,” Leigh says. “There were rows about nothing really. And what Dr Leigh was really doing, of course, was giving me a lifetime’s ammunition for my film-making. But the screaming matches were awful, terrible, horrifying to remember.”</p> <p>When the teenage Leigh, who went on to win a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, showed an interest in acting, his father urged him to shake off his ambitions as “the moonings of a stagestruck girly”.</p> <p>After failing all but three of his O-level exams, Leigh went to London to study acting in the early 1960s. He later won the role of a deaf mute in an episode of the popular TV series <em>Maigret</em>, but then lost interest in performing.</p> <p>Leigh remembers his nascent interest in film-making first taking hold when he was a boy in Salford attending a funeral, a Jewish wake or shiva held at a family home. As he watched the coffin being carried downstairs and listened to a family argument die down, Leigh tells Yentob he suddenly thought it would make a great film. “It was already a tragi-comic scene, you see,” he says.</p> <p>In London the director eventually attracted funding for his first film from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/albert-finney\" title=\"link to Guardian profile site\">the actor/director Albert Finney</a>, who was then in his mid-30s. Finney decided to use his newfound wealth to fund three films: one by Stephen Frears, who made <em>Gumshoe,</em> starring Finney; another by Tony Scott, called <em>Loving Memory</em>; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/01/mike-leigh-on-bleak-moments\" title=\"link to Leigh on this film\">Leigh’s <em>Bleak Moments</em></a>, which was hailed by the late American film critic Roger Ebert as a masterpiece.</p> <p>In the <em>Imagine</em> documentary, Leigh talks through his early career in theatre and television, before he was finally able to attract funding to make a feature film again, 17 years later, still using his trademark improvisational techniques.</p> <p>Leigh has two sons with his former wife, the actress Alison Steadman, and, according to one of them, he may not have an entirely encouraging attitude to the arts himself. Interviewed in 2009, his son Leo Leigh, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/17/leo-leigh-swansea-love-story1\" title=\"link to Guardian interview\">also a film-maker</a>, jokingly revealed that his father had warned him away from acting “from junior school. My dad said: ‘If you become an actor, I’ll break your legs.’ ”</p> <p><em>Imagine will be screened on Tuesday 25 November at 10.35pm on BBC1

There he changed his name to Mohamed Husen and appeared in films alongside some of the country’s most famous actors, sometimes in movies that championed German imperialism, before ending up in a concentration camp for having an on-set interracial relationship.</p> <p>“I didn’t know much about Africans in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s,” says Knopf. “It seems like German people’s awareness of colonialism was washed away because of the second world war and the Holocaust. We lost our colonies after the first world war, so we felt we didn’t have to deal with them any more. Our history with them didn’t reach into the 1950s and 1960s like it did in many other European countries. So, the metaphor of the extra represents both the extras themselves and the absence of Africans from the German imagination.”</p> <p>Born in 1905, Husen volunteered, aged nine, for the Askari, elite native troops who helped Germany keep a tight grip on its dominions. “No one in Germany would expect that Kaiser Wilhelm had child soldiers,” reflects Knopf. “Some would carry weapons to the frontline. This was very dangerous anyway, but they couldn’t even use the weapons to defend themselves.”</p> <p>Husen’s father died during the first world war and he, too, was injured in service. Later, he got a job as a ship steward and sailed to Hamburg before heading to Berlin where, defiantly and unsuccessfully, he demanded back wages he claimed were owed to his family. He was instructed to leave the country, but the order wasn’t carefully administered and he stayed on without papers. He married a white actor, fathered a child by his mistress and eked out a living by working in costume at a cowboy-themed bar, at an Africa-themed circus and as a Swahili teacher at Berlin University’s Foreign Institute, where he primed civil servants for life in Africa.</p> <p>At this time, port and working-class communities in Hamburg and Berlin had significant black populations. The popularity of performers such as Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson offered migrants the chance to pretend to be from the US. Often they drifted between jobs in cabaret, dance and acting. Husen found blink-and-miss-them roles as a bellboy, a waiter and a saloon-bar lag, which, says Knopf, were two-dimensional. “He and other black performers were portrayed more or less as children.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04aba0fad913789f7671035c98990addd8b7e4e0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415897646928/835214dd-973f-4157-b88d-d72abe8d5455-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"majub statue\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A statue of Majub, whose story was pieced together by director Eva Knopf. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rainer Hoffmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet, for many German Africans, life on a film set was better than life outside. The studio was a safety zone, a place of make-believe rather than austere reality, a money-earning gig, a hub for gossip and friendship. According to Dorothea Diek, quoted in Robbie Aitken and Eve Rosenhaft’s study Black Germany (2013), “It was cheerful and cosy: no politics, no Nazis, just happy people. We were all together – young and old Africans.” On the set of Husen’s last film, German Africans were so aghast at the shivering, emaciated Togolese PoWs they performed alongside that they banded together to give them cigarettes and clothes.</p> <p>It was also on that set that Husen’s fortunes took a dramatic tumble. He was playing Ramazan, the loyal servant of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvV6DwsrY0\">Carl Peters</a> in Herbert Selpin’s 1941 biopic of the German explorer and Scramble for Africa conquistador. Peters was infamous for executing his black mistress after he discovered she was having an affair with his man-servant. Husen was denounced by an informant for his extramarital affair and sent, purportedly for his own safety, to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp\">Sachsenhausen</a>, where he died four years later.</p> <p>Other film-makers might have portrayed Husen as a pioneer or hero, a symbol of Germany’s far-from-glorious relationship with people of African descent. Knopf’s screenplay is spare and ruminative, as keen to point out how little is – and could be – known about him as it is to celebrate his life. “I don’t know if I liked him,” she says. “He wasn’t what the Nazis wanted him to be – a proper Askari. But nor was he what we would want him to be – an anti-colonial freedom fighter or an anti-fascist.” Indeed, by the mid-1930s, he was dressing up in military gear and appearing at rallies in front of banners bearing the slogan “Germany needs colonies”. “He went his own way. He doesn’t fit any clear-cut patterns of how we might think about history.”</p> <p>Some may think Husen a chump. What kind of fool would have travelled to a recent imperial giant hoping for social recognition or economic justice? “He took the Germans at their word,” suggests Knopf. “He was never meant to appear in Germany. He was just a fantasy, a story they told about themselves and about how faithful the Askari were and how much the Germans honoured them. You have to wonder: did he just not understand what he was doing?”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://vimeo.com/77801442\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/77801442\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for Majub’s Journey, featuring footage of the actor from the era.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Husen’s life is rich in mystery. No diaries, correspondence or personal photographs appear to have survived. Knopf found a sheet of notepaper that he had personally designed, but it contained no writing. His name would not have been listed in credit sequences, and no trade magazines would have interviewed him; after all, as the film’s narrator comments, “extras are there only for the clothes they wear and the spot of moving colour that they bring to the screen.”</p> <p>His 12-year-old son, Heinz Bodo, supposedly collected his father’s ashes, but it seems likely that he died soon after during the bombing of Berlin.</p> <p>In a sense, Husen is a ghost, one who, like many immigrants from formerly colonised nations, is barely visible even upon arriving at the imperial centre. What non-filmic traces of him exist are down to his run-ins with the authorities – asking for help with rent, seeking compensation for military valour. Immersing herself in the archives, watching countless films from the period, trying to make out Husen in scenes captured on now-degraded stock, Knopf became a kind of surveillance operative. At the same time, she worried that bringing these forgotten images back into circulation would heap fresh humiliation on him.</p> <p>Yet, what makes Majub’s Journey so compelling is its artfully conveyed tension between the desire to liberate Husen from anonymity and the suspicion that his absence from the cinephilic record may be a blessing in disguise. “History is often written on the basis of what survives,” says Knopf. “But there are all these histories and tragedies and lost voices and souls that also shape the way our world is today. When you screen these films, you can make these ghosts appear again.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong>: A new film tells the unlikely

Ghostbusters reboot is official: who they gonna cast?","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-10-08T22:36:53Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>A new Ghostbusters film is on the way, and this time women will be doing most of the busting.<br /></p> <p>Director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat) confirmed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulfeig/status/519939618264088576\">on Twitter</a> Wednesday long-swirling rumors of a Ghostbusters reboot, and announced that Katie Dippold (Parks and Recreation, The Heat) is helping write it. “It’s official,” Feig wrote. “I’m making a new Ghostbusters &amp; writing it with<a href=\"https://twitter.com/katiedippold\"> @katiedippold</a> &amp; yes, it will star hilarious women. That’s who I’m gonna call.”</p> <p>The original Ghostbusters movie is like a lot of other films: the story of a group of men whose technological innovation, devil-may-care attitude and entrepreneurial spirit lead them to take advantage of an unexpected spike in demand. It’s just that their particular good fortune was a paranormal invasion of New York City.</p> <p>But it was a huge hit, making more at the box office than anything else in 1984 but Beverly Hills Cop (<a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1984&amp;p=.htm\">and that includes</a> Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). </p> <p>The new movie will not be a sequel so much as a “total reboot”, Variety <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/paul-feig-ghostbusters-comedy-reboot-1201274332/\">has reported</a>. Ivan Reitman, who directed the original movie and Ghostbusters II, dropped out of directing a third movie in the series in March, the report said.</p> <p>It’s not that there were no hilarious women in the original movie, which was written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and starred the writers plus Bill Murray. In Ghostbusters, Sigourney Weaver plays a New Yorker whose apartment in <a href=\"http://www.bigwaste.com/photos/ny/ghostbusters/barrett.shtml\">55 Central Park West</a> becomes haunted. So she commutes to <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hook-and-ladder-8-ghostbusters-new-york\">Hook &amp; Ladder 8</a> in Tribeca, where the Ghostbusters have set up their headquarters. Before the movie is over she delivers witty ripostes to Murray’s jokes, levitates over a bed and makes love to Rick Moranis. (Weaver has announced her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/09/ghostbusters-3-sigourney-weaver-son\">son would appear</a> in the third film.)</p> <p>There should be ample opportunity for the writers of the new movie to riff on the original, which used sex as a metaphor for the ghost apocalypse, with Weaver playing the “gatekeeper”, Moranis playing the “keymaster” and their unearthly offspring embodied by a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=slavitza+jovan&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1418&amp;bih=1038&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IKg1VPztL5Dd7Qb_v4DYDg&amp;ved=0CCAQsAQ\">Serbian supermodel</a>. </p> <p>One thing they’ll have a hard time beating: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc\">that theme song</a>.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"Bridesmaids’ Paul Feig announces he will direct and co-write reboot about women of paranormal pest extermination team","headline":"Women-led Ghostbusters reboot is official: who they gonna cast?","byline":"Tom McCarthy in New York","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/42a5x","wordcount":"352","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412804742672/90a36f67-0b04-46dd-bd66-991f0799fabd-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-11T22:36:53Z","standfirst":"<p>Bridesmaids’ Paul Feig announces he will direct and co-write reboot about women of paranormal pest extermination team</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/08/new-ghostbusters-paul-feig-women-reboot-stars","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/oct/08/new-ghostbusters-paul-feig-women-reboot-stars","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/ghostbusters","webTitle":"Ghostbusters","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/ghostbusters","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tommccarthy","webTitle":"Tom McCarthy","r2ContributorId":"49576","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/24/1382626910884/tom-mccarthy.jpg","firstName":"tom","lastName":"mccarthy","twitterHandle":"TeeMcSee","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom McCarthy is national affairs correspondent for Guardian US.

The Messenger: the Gary Webb story has holes but Renner's performance still sticks – review","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-09-26T17:28:26Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>He has a sturdy build, a clear moral compass, wears cool sunglasses and rides a vintage motorcycle. Everything about Jeremy Renner’s portrayal of journalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb\">Gary Webb</a> in Kill the Messenger readies a conditioned moviegoer to expect him to kick ass in the name of justice. But this is a movie for grownups, so <a href=\"http://www.blastr.com/2013-5-16/rumor-day-jeremy-renner%E2%80%99s-being-replaced-hawkeye-avengers-2\">The Avengers’ Hawkeye</a> puts down the bow and arrow and picks up his pen – or more specifically his mid-90s desktop mouse – and uses his brain instead of his brawn. </p> <p>Webb was the relatively small potatoes reporter at the San Jose Mercury News whose fearlessness and determination helped him break an amazing story, and Renner gives this role everything he’s got.</p> <p>As a middle schooler in the 80s, I befriended some older kids who read ‘zines and listened to the Clash and wore jackets with tiny pins on them like Rick from the Young Ones. One such pin read CIA: Cocaine Import Agency. Even suburban twerps from New Jersey suspected that the government was pumping crack into the inner cities and using the cash to fund anti-communist Nicaraguan militias. There was never any proof of this – at least not then, but a decade later Gary Webb connected many of the dots in a series of articles that, at first, had him hailed as the next Woodward and Bernstein, but that’s only the first half of the story. The second part, and, frankly, the more interesting part, shows how forces conspired to bury the story. </p> <p>“Some stories are too true to tell,” warns Michael Sheen as the DC insider beside a reflecting pool – where all movies are forced by law to shoot the scene where a DC insider warns reporters they are in too deep. But Webb won’t be waved away. Not because he has an anti-government radical agenda, but because he’s still naïve enough to think that a journalist owes his first duty to the truth. </p> <p>After the initial splash of success comes the backlash. The CIA refutes every claim (naturally) and even do a little psy-ops on him. But the CIA doesn’t have to destroy Webb when his so-called colleagues are there to do the job. </p> <p>Bigger papers like the Washington Post are humiliated that they got scooped by a pipsqueak outlet like the San Jose Mercury News, and with the aid of the CIA’s mouthpiece they commence with the policy of CYA (Cover Your Ass). By tearing Webb’s story apart (and, by extension, Webb himself) the mainstream press can sweep all this under the rug.</p> <p>It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes. Yet the film in total – if I may paraphrase Webb’s critics – has a number of holes. Its use of newsy exposition montage is deplorable (the pre-title sequence is exhausting) and a number of characters just drop in to shove the plot along to its next checkpoint.</p> <p>Much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game than drama. Director Michael Cuesta (best known for helming cable shows like Homeland and Dexter) makes a few choices that aren’t exactly what you’d call subtle. He’s got Barry Pepper as the sleazy government operative and Michael Kenneth Williams as the drug dealer primed with bon mots. And when Webb sits down to actually bang out his report he cranks The Clash’s “Know Your Rights.” (Those pin-wearing chums from school would be proud.) When Webb gives a rousing speech endorsing truth, justice and the American way at the film’s conclusion, he’s at a banquet and the light off the back curtain frames him with a golden halo.</p> <p>And yet what Renner’s selling still sticks, because he’s just that sympathetic (and, of course, on the right side of the issues.) I remember when the Webb story broke and then I also remember people shoo-ing it away. What I didn’t remember was the aftermath. I won’t spoil too much of that here, but <em>why</em> I don’t remember it is clear: when evidence supporting Webb’s claim came to light, it had the misfortune of surfacing when the American media had its eyes exclusively on Bill Clinton’s zipper.</p> <p>Kill the Messenger (like Webb) is clear about the line between fact and conjecture – but the facts alone make this an “issue film” worth seeing.<br /></p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes, but much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game","starRating":"3","headline":"Kill The Messenger: the Gary Webb story has holes but Renner's performance still sticks – review","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/42vdc","wordcount":"713","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/26/1411750078616/8bdc8a15-6d88-4ea2-a320-4447cfb21e1f-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-29T17:28:36Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes, but much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/26/kill-the-messenger-gary-webb-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/sep/26/kill-the-messenger-gary-webb-review","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.
