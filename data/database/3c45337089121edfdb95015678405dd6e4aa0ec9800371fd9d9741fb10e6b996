NWA came straight outta Compton and went mainstream","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-08-14T14:00:05Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1796","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4bf37","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>At the (very brief) height of their powers, the rap crew <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2015/aug/10/nwa-straight-outta-compton-1988-video\">NWA</a> were labelled “the most dangerous group in the world”. They united liberal left and reactionary right in disgust at their works, and were considered worthy of the unfriendly, and very public, attentions of America’s security services. A quarter of a century later – with a new biopic about their phosphorescent impact on popular culture about to be released, and an imminent induction into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/29/vinylword.joequeenan\">Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame</a> – NWA are completing an unlikely transition from controversy and harassment to acceptance and acclaim.</p> <p>Formed from the bits and pieces of other Los Angeles groups, and financed by the drugs profits of one of their members (Eric “Eazy-E” Wright), NWA were, in retrospect, always going to be trouble. Their name alone told you that. Even as cocksure a bunch as Eazy and his cohorts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/drdre\">Dr Dre</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/icecube\">Ice Cube</a>, DJ Yella and MC Ren must have known they’d never get away with Niggaz Wit Attitude (the quintet’s full moniker), so they settled on the initials. It didn’t matter. The inevitable questions about those three capital letters meant that the message got through loud and clear.</p> <p>The late 1980s rap world they entered was dominated by acts from America’s eastern seaboard, and by groups brilliantly espousing assorted brands of virtuousness and positivity. In the autumn of 1988, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/public-enemy\">Public Enemy</a> released their magnificent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/11/public-enemy-nation-millions-hold-us-back\"><em>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</em></a>, a flaming torch of righteous indignation. The following spring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/de-la-soul\">De La Soul</a> unfurled their trippy masterpiece, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/29/how-we-made-3-feet-high-and-rising-de-la-soul\"><em>Three Feet High and Risin</em>g</a>, a lyrical firework display of child-like wonder. In the summer of 1989, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop\">hip-hop</a> was East Coast, right-on and increasingly respectable. NWA’s first album blew all that to smithereens.</p> <p><em>Straight Outta Compton</em> was, and remains, extraordinary, right from the first second. A record otherwise characterised by howling waves of noise and lyrical vitriol, it begins with a stunning moment of quiet certainty, as a single voice announces “You are about to witness the power of street knowledge.” The three songs that follow are perhaps the most powerful opening salvo in music, a roaring cascade of youthful rage, all spat out in a black, urban slang previously hidden from most of the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F5WcFPDzko\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-F5WcFPDzko?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Straight Outta Compton official film trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The title track introduces the band members in a welter of profanity, braggadocio and middle-finger-raised political incorrectness. “Fuck tha Police” follows, its shockingly explicit description of the treatment of young black males by the LAPD a disturbing snapshot of life just down the road from Hollywood, and a chilling prophecy of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rodney-king\">Rodney King</a> beatings and the subsequent riots a few years later. Today, protesters in the streets of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/10/ferguson-shooting-gunfire-heard-during-anniversary-rally\">Ferguson</a>, Missouri wear “Fuck tha Police” T-shirts. The third bullet fired into the heart of the status quo is “Gangsta Gangsta”. Utterly unapologetic in its brutal portrayal of street life in the LA suburbs of Compton, Watts and South Central, it casually unveils a universe of drugs, firearms and no-ties sex.</p> <p>All of this is heightened by the music itself. Where Public Enemy had crafted soundscapes that were echoes of the dysfunctional housing projects, NWA’s record is marbled with real gunshots, sirens and screams. The effect is disorienting, caught somewhere between a cartoon and a madly heightened reality, the authenticity of which the majority of listeners and critics were in no position to confirm or deny.</p> <p>Despite a total lack of radio support, the record sold well, if not spectacularly; it took four years to pass 1m copies. But, like the first albums by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/velvetunderground\">Velvet Underground</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sexpistols\">Sex Pistols</a>, <em>SOC</em>’s success is more usefully measured by its influence, by the things it changed and set in train, than by the units it shifted. NWA established the US’s West Coast as a vibrant centre of hip-hop production, setting up a rivalry with the music’s old East Coast stronghold that would ultimately result in the killings of two of the music’s biggest stars, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2pac\">2Pac</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/24/notorious-big-i-got-feelings-too-you-know\">Notorious BIG.</a> Equally, the lyrical concerns and largely apolitical, amoral stance of the music set the blueprint for the musical style that would dominate the US charts for the next decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"654a754acd71d27ab2444f49d430113c35b83c8f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439399026257/18cd97a7-dd2c-4a72-9424-dc1077bc290f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Straight Outta Compton film still.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Straight Outta Compton. Photograph: Jaimie Trueblood</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NWA didn’t invent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/01/gangsta-rap-dead-gone-hip-hop\">gangsta rap</a> (they’d picked up on themes previously iterated in, among others, Schoolly D’s “Saturday Night” and Ice-T’s “6 in the Mornin’ ”) but they did send it spinning into the mainstream, opening artistic and commercial doors for a stampede of less talented fellow travellers and wannabes.</p> <p>They even changed the way rap looked. Black jeans were topped by the colours of LA’s ice-hockey team, the Kings, and the city’s football franchise, the Raiders; both predominantly wore black. The Raiders were a particularly apt symbol for rebellious youth, habitually employing the ne’er-do-wells, mischief-makers and head-bangers other sports clubs eschewed. The black and silver Raiders’ baseball caps and bomber jackets have remained a large part of rap fans’ wardrobes for the last 25 years. Indeed, people who have never heard of NWA wear them without having the faintest idea why; the Raiders cap has become the hip-hop equivalent of rock’s ubiquitous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ramones\">Ramones</a> T-shirt.</p> <p>The band were not able to enjoy the fame (or notoriety) that followed their debut release. The things they said, and the way they said them, saw them engulfed by criticism and opprobrium. Conservatives feared them as radicals. Liberals despised the perceived misogyny, homophobia and nihilism of their lyrics. Black activist groups thought they painted negative portraits of African-American masculinity. And in interview after interview they were forced to defend the charge that they glorified violence.</p> <p>The drama was also playing itself out in the pages of the then powerful British music press. Looking back, it now seems incredible just how much kerfuffle the arrival of hip-hop caused, and how vehement the arguments became. I was assistant editor, and then editor, of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/nme\">NME</a>, the best-selling weekly, at the time; I remember going to Long Island to interview Public Enemy for a cover piece just as <em>Nation of Millions</em> was breaking big. When I got back, I wrote the cover headline “Public Enemy: The Greatest Rock’n’roll Band in the World!?!” The debate that followed – about whether hip-hop was real music, never mind rock’n’roll, about the fact that they’d used the word “Bitch” in the title of one of their songs, about every last detail – went on (in the office, in the paper, in the letters page) for months.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMZi25Pq3T8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMZi25Pq3T8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>NWA performing Straight Outta Compton</figcaption> </figure>   <p>NWA’s worldview, vocabulary and apparent disregard for what anyone else thought meant that they divided opinion even more fiercely. For my colleague the late Steven Wells aka Seething Wells (ranting poet, funny man, and card carrying leftie firebrand) they were manna from heaven, just the kind of freebooting insurgents who were sure to destroy the running dogs and lackies of the west. After much nagging, he was sent to LA to meet the band, and no doubt help co-ordinate the downfall of capitalism. He returned puce with anger, pickling in his own disappointment. Far from sharing his revolutionary zeal, it turned out that the boys from the ’hood were planning to buy very large utility vehicles and gaudy cribs in comfortable suburbs. Ice Cube, indeed, had already made the move and – class criminal! – had ornamental ducks on his front lawn. Steve’s piece was pretty negative, but the ding-dong over the headline (his idea, unrepeatable here, would have had the paper closed) went on for several very late nights.</p> <p>Arguments about cultural differences, cultural imperialism, race, freedom of speech, the political power of language, the place of music and the meaning of lawn ducks… week after week, month after month, the table-slamming about hip-hop and rap went on, all to the soundtrack of some of the most exciting music I’d ever heard. It was a great time to be at that table. For NWA, though, this culminated in America’s law enforcers and security services getting involved. At the centre of the new film (also called <em>Straight Outta Compton</em>) is the 18-month face-off with the authorities which led to the harassment and arrest of the band members and their management.</p> <p>Concerts were routinely cancelled for reasons of public decency; when they did go ahead, they did so under the watchful eyes of the police. At a gig in Chicago, officers rushed the stage to prevent them playing “Fuck tha Police”. It seems surreal now but Milt Ahlerich, the FBI’s assistant director, actually found time in his schedule to write the band a stern letter expressing the bureau’s deep concern about their activities.</p> <p>The pressure told. The quintet – part of whose appeal was that they appeared to be part of some kind of brotherhood, however unchivalrous – began to fall out with one another. Ice Cube, the group’s most erudite spokesman, departed. The second, and final, album, <em>Efil4Zaggin</em>, (<em>Niggaz4Life</em>) sounds good, Dr Dre further honing the swaggering mid-tempo groove that came to be called G-funk. But the record was blighted by lyrics that crossed the line between the forcefully expressed, if often unpalatable ideas of <em>SOC</em>, and puerile, genuinely offensive, controversy for its own sake.</p> <p>The record sold by the barrowload – particularly to white suburban kids desperate to clamber aboard gangsta rap’s chrome-wheeled bandwagon – but nobody plays it much today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e07f5017b879018860d907ca2663bab44f97660\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439478180560/be8196ac-40cc-41f8-833c-d563a79871e3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube in Anaconda (1997).

Photograph: Allstar/Columbia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The split, soon after, was inevitable; too much energy had been expended in dealing with the reaction to what they’d created. Eazy-E died of an Aids-related illness in 1995, aged just 31. The lives and careers of the rest of the band are an illustration of just how accepting the mainstream can be of artists once thought to be beyond the pale. MC Ren and DJ Yella have continued to make music, and the latter has also directed, by his own count, more than 300 adult films. Dr Dre is a towering figure of modern music, having driven the careers of, among others, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg\">Snoop Dogg</a>, Eminem and 50 Cent. He’s also phenomenally wealthy. In 2001, he sold his share of the Interscope record company for more than $50m (£32m), but even that was rendered chicken feed when Apple recently bought his headphones company, Beats, for $3bn – a deal described by Forbes magazine as “the single biggest payday of any musician in history”.</p> <p>Ice Cube has turned to film production and acting – in increasingly poor movies. It’s a shocking moment (a bit like watching Johnny Rotten selling you margarine on TV), when watching <em>Anaconda</em>, you realise that the man being regurgitated by the giant snake was once a scourge of the establishment and a threat to American national security.</p> <p><em>• Straight Outta Compton</em> is on general release from 28 August.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"From pariahs to candidates for the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame: ahead of a biopic tracing NWA’s career, Danny Kelly recalls

To celebrate his brief return, here’s a look at his career highs.</p> <h2>Maurice</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBj8YWpNkms\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HBj8YWpNkms?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Before he became synonymous with comedy, Grant played a rather more serious upper-class Englishman in James Ivory’s deeply moving forbidden romance. He plays the first love of the titular character in a time when homosexuality was still a crime. It’s a restrained, tender performance, filled with small yet meaningful moments of affection, and is easily Grant’s finest dramatic turn.</p> <h2>Four Weddings and a Funeral</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogl0mA_15ys\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogl0mA_15ys?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Grant’s breakout role came in 1994 with this phenomenally successful romantic comedy that provided both him and writer Richard Curtis with a blueprint that they took into the next decade. Grant’s foppish shtick was born, and it proved cosily popular with an international audience, thrusting him into the spotlight, stumbling and sputtering out sweet nothings.</p> <h2>Bridget Jones’s Diary</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gxOffgz6VI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gxOffgz6VI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>After playing a rather terribly polite gent started to get a little too familiar, Grant smartly subverted expectations by taking on the role of a caddish womaniser in this hit chick-lit adaptation. His most memorable moment involved him getting embroiled in a disastrously realistic tussle with his love rival, played by Colin Firth. </p> <h2>About a Boy</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtYAzKwm-R0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtYAzKwm-R0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Wisely avoiding the archetype that he’d made for himself, Grant stuck with <a href=\"https://www.workingtitlefilms.com/about\">Working Title</a> but played a selfish man-child in this smart adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel about growing up late. Unafraid to be unlikeable, it continued to show a different side to Grant, and that he was able to do more than offer stumbling speeches to attractive women. </p> <h2>Music &amp; Lyrics</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVkU8dDSC9w\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVkU8dDSC9w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of Grant’s few American excursions to pay off (Two Weeks Notice is another arguable highlight), saw him play a has-been pop star falling for plant-waterer turned songwriter Drew Barrymore. It’s soft but engaging stuff that peaks at the beginning as we see Grant perform his biggest hit in a video for the deviously catchy Pop! Goes My Heart. </p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"A look back at the career of Richard Curtis’s favourite leading man, currently stealing the show in The Man From

In the video the gravel-voiced Compton rapper leans forward in a chair, placed dead centre of a smoky, shadowy classroom, to bark doomy bars into the sanguine face of Hollywood superstar Michelle Pfeiffer. </p> <p>Coolio’s single came out a few days before the accompanying film – they both celebrate their 20th anniversary of American release this week – and together they created a pop cultural storm. The song, with its inspired Stevie Wonder hook, became the biggest selling single of 1995. The film, which starred Pfeiffer as a plucky, leather-jacketed teacher inspiring a collection of hardscrabble, mostly black and Latino kids in a tough California school program, cleaned up at the box office, raking in just shy of $85m against a modest budget of $29m. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-nYl-iZKyg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-nYl-iZKyg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Reviews were generally poor (“Stereotypical, predictable and simplified to the point of meaninglessness”, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-11/entertainment/ca-33858_1_dangerous-minds\">complained the Los Angeles Times</a>; “sentimental and often strains credibility”, <a href=\"http://variety.com/1995/film/reviews/dangerous-minds-1200442542/\">said Variety</a>) but they didn’t matter: the film’s lead performance – Pfeiffer floats through the film without dislodging a single honeyed, shimmering lock – and triumph-over-adversity narrative struck a chord with audiences nationwide. It could even afford to leave an entire romantic subplot between Pfeiffer and then-Hollywood heartthrob Andy Garcia on the cutting room floor.</p> <p>Dangerous Minds was based on the autobiographical 1992 book My Posse Don’t Do Homework by US Marine-turned-teacher LouAnne Johnson, who is now in her 60s and still teaching. She recalls the project’s genesis with a combination of fondness and bemusement: “They called me and said, ‘We are going to make a movie. Who do you think should play you?’ I said, ‘Oh, I don’t know… Bette Midler?’ Then they told me that Michelle Pfeiffer read it and wanted to do it. I think it was [producer] Jerry Bruckheimer who said: ‘Michelle probably won’t play it because she’s too pretty to be a teacher… but I didn’t mean to insult you’. I said: ‘I know you didn’t, therefore I won’t rip your lips off… although I have been trained to do that!’”</p> <p>Johnson, who describes herself as “outspoken”, had no interest in kow-towing to Hollywood royalty. “I think Bruckheimer and [co-producer] Don Simpson were insulted because I didn’t know how famous they were,” she says. “They came to my classroom, with Pfeiffer – I knew who she was, but when they introduced themselves I said: ‘So Mr Bruckheimer, have you made any movies I might have seen?’ And he said Flashdance, Sleeping With The Enemy, and I said: ‘Oh! If I’d known you were famous I’d have been more impressed.’ I was kidding, but they didn’t know what to think!”</p> <h2>Perpetuating a myth</h2> <p>Johnson visited the set once, and soon twigged that her story was being changed beyond recognition. She did not, she says, attempt to teach the kids about poetry by organising a Dylan Thomas v Bob Dylan contest (one of its most famous scenes); rather, she used rap lyrics. Some of the most obvious tinkering came with the ethnic makeup of her students. </p> <p>“In my class, the kids were evenly mixed: black, white and Hispanic. In the movie they made it all minority kids with a token white kid here and there. That perpetuates this myth that only minority kids are at risk, and that white kids don’t have any problems.” </p> <p>Consequently, although Dangerous Minds means well, it’s notable for being one of the most egregious examples of Hollywood’s “white saviour” trope, in which a white hero/ine will act as the truth, the light and the way for some blighted minority figure(s) (see also: Freedom Writers; The Blind Side; and this year’s Kevin Costner mush-fest, McFarland USA). </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVF-nirSq5s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVF-nirSq5s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In the film, Johnson pointedly takes a special interest in three particular students: reluctant gang member Raúl Sanchero (Renoly Santiago); Callie Roberts (Bruklin Harris), a young black student who gets pregnant; and Emilio Ramírez (Wade Domínguez), who becomes embroiled in a fatal personal conflict with a hardened criminal acquaintance. In one scene, Johnson is branded a “white bread bitch” by an enraged grandparent of African American twins who have dropped out of class. Johnson tells me that this never happened. “I asked them ‘where did that come from?’ They said: ‘We were sure that some of the black and the Hispanic parents <em>must</em> have resented you’. I said: ‘For what? For helping their kids? Hell, nobody ever, ever said anything to me like that.’”</p> <p>Director John N Smith, a veteran of the National Film Board of Canada who was handpicked by Bruckheimer to make his Hollywood debut, takes responsibility for the changes: “I had done a feature on black kids in Montreal and I felt that it needed that kind of edge,” he told me. I ask him what he means by “edge”. “A more political point of view. As something much tougher for a white middle-class teacher to confront – kids who have in their normal daily lives all kinds of issues to face. When you happen to be walking through a park and there are cops there, you could end up in trouble.” </p> <p>It’s a laudable aim, but one that’s not truly reflected in the film, which ultimately sidelines the kids’ experiences to make Johnson the focus. In its final scene, the kids, after begging her to stay, paraphrase Dylan Thomas to literally tell her: “We see you as being our light!”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>The real Emilio joined the Marine Corps, and settled down with a wife and kids</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The real-life Johnson, however, was most annoyed by the filmmakers’ decision to kill off Emilio for the sake of climactic dramatic impact. In fact, the real Emilio joined the Marine Corps, and settled down in California with a wife and kids. </p> <p>Ironically, tragedy would soon strike Wade Domínguez, the chiselled actor who portrayed Emilio. He died from respiratory failure in 1998 at the age of just 32. Renoly Santiago, who played his rival Raúl, recalls their friendship: “We were close. He was the nicest person, and he was very vulnerable. When I look back on it, he was on that James Dean trip. He confessed to being very insecure to me, and so I always took it as ‘Are you just trying to flatter me?’, but he had lived a nomadic life.</p> <p>“He looks like a superman in the movie; he did everything in one take. I don’t know the details of how he died, but he would have been a household name by now.”</p> <p>It’s largely thanks to the gritty performances of young performers like Dominguez and Santiago, and the rest of the ensemble cast – few of whom were trained actors – that Dangerous Minds works: “I loved them so much, and the life and honesty and the energy they brought”, recalls Smith. The film’s best moments are the unpredictable classroom sequences which bristle with tension, infusing an overly glossy product with a tang of authenticity. Santiago recalls them fondly: “They were fun! But it was like being in a real rough reform school, where you knew that if you fucked with somebody, there was going to be a fight. There were some arguments. The girls were tough, and there was this one girl who regulated everything. She was ready to kick anyone’s behind, and she would have beat up any bullies.” </p> <p>So how does Johnson look back on the film today? “I cry every time I see it. I think it inspired a lot of people. I can whine about the changes, but overall it had a good effect. Some young people got to become actors who might not have had a chance.” One such actor, Santiago, who today teaches and performs in New York, becomes emotional at the memory. “I remember we were all on the beach, shooting the scene at the amusement park. I was 19 turning 20. We were all together, and I said ‘this is the best time of my life.’ We all nodded our heads. There is so much love in that film, and so much pure intent. We had so much fun. I secretly felt – even being that young – that that was a special moment... that it could really be a great, great thing that happened.”</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"It was a big hit in 1995 with lackluster reviews, but even the woman who inspired it has reservations about the film starring Michelle Pfeiffer","headline":"Dangerous Minds at 20: has the ultimate white saviour story aged well?","byline":"Ashley Clark","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/0c342b3cdf877fda51b92485fc2417fee304a32f/0_77_2271_1362/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-17T09:00:00-04:00","standfirst":"<p>It was a big hit in 1995 with lackluster reviews, but even the woman who inspired it has reservations about the film starring Michelle Pfeiffer</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/14/dangerous-minds-at-20-has-the-ultimate-white-saviour-story-aged-well","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/aug/14/dangerous-minds-at-20-has-the-ultimate-white-saviour-story-aged-well","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ashley-clark","webTitle":"Ashley Clark","r2ContributorId":"68246","firstName":"ashley","lastName":"clark","twitterHandle":"_ash_clark","type":"contributor","sectionId":"artanddesign","bio":"<p>Ashley Clark is freelance film journalist and film programmer from London, based in New York.

<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F5WcFPDzko\">the NWA biopic</a> in cinemas this month, there is a scene backstage where DJ Yella is chastised by Eazy-E before a concert. Not because of the music but because Yella is wearing, well, a yellow vest. NWA’s colour scheme – black and silver, like their football team, the LA Raiders – was crucial. It was as much part of their star power as tracks that expressed the blistering anger of young black men on the streets of LA in the late eighties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/straight-outta-compton-film-ice-cube\">Straight Outta Compton: fact-checking the film … with Ice Cube</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like Public Enemy (<a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/crop-images/2013/09/04/Public%20Enemy%20Getty%20David%20Corio%201987.jpg\">military jacket, baseball caps, massive clocks</a>) and Run DMC (<a href=\"http://www.rundmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rundmc-glasswall-570x330.jpg\">Adidas, Kangol, Lee jeans</a>) before them, NWA knew the power of image in hip-hop. The monochrome scheme consisted of Raiders gear: caps and jackets (Ice T even says this is on his successful-rapper shopping list during a press conference in the film), black sweatshirts, long-sleeved white T-shirts and Carhartt-style work jackets. The chunky gold chains – a remnant of the block party style in the Bronx of the early 80s – connects old school hip hop to a new 90s era when hip-hop hit global domination and, whether through <a href=\"http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2014/09/Biggies-Greatest-Fashion-Moments-08.jpg\">Biggie’s tailoring</a> or Missy Elliott’s Boxfresh tracksuits, smartened up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c20ce91a4424ffaefa83ad3be8bd49d5d35ecb9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/14/1439546588955/cb834cd1-6131-470c-b1c7-04897bf530fa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"NWA as portrayed in biopic Straight Outta Compton.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NWA as portrayed in biopic Straight Outta Compton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NWA’s monochrome streetwear has even influenced how young men dress now. Inspired by contemporary rappers who are also style influencers. New York label Hood By Air – worn by A$AP Rocky and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/09/from-normcore-to-sportswear-how-drake-became-fashions-latest-alt-darling \">Drake</a> – is almost entirely monochrome, with massive slogans over hoodies and long-sleeved T-shirts. Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/givenchy\">Givenchy</a>, designed by Kanye West’s BFF Riccardo Tisci, routinely uses black and white on its boxy T-shirts and sweatshirts. The spring/summer 2016 menswear show had around 20 looks in this colour scheme. <a href=\"http://www.cottweiler.com\">Cottweiler</a>, the London label on the up, took the tracksuits and trainers and made them a bit futuristic.

There are celebrations on the streets of Seoul, as analysts debate what will happen next. </p> <p>The opening scenes of <a href=\"http://whiletheywatched.wix.com/film\">While They Watched</a>, a new film about North Korea, imagines what would happen were the regime to collapse. Set in an unspecified time in the near-future, it uses archive footage and interviews with former prison guards, defectors, and human rights activists to build up a picture of what we know about the totalitarian state – and to accuse the world of “wilful blindness” for failing to intervene. </p> <p>North Korea’s government stands accused of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-united-nations\">widespread atrocities </a>and  the country’s young leader, Kim Jong-un, has been warned by the United Nations that he could face charges for crimes against humanity.<br /></p> <p>Yet the film points out that despite evidence from investigators and defectors alike, no real action has been taken.  </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-united-nations\">North Korea human rights abuses resemble those of the Nazis, says UN inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Director Jake Smith said he had been a “naive Londoner” until he read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/29/the-best-books-on-north-korea\">Nothing to Envy</a>, a damning book about life in North Korea written by Barbara Demick. “I decided to dig deeper,” he said. “I moved to South Korea and began meeting defectors and finding out if these things were true. I was shocked.” </p> <p>He decided to make the film as a plea to world leaders to take a stance. It got off the ground thanks to £1,500 pledged on crowd-funding site Indiegogo, before securing support from a South Korean production company. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62af251877e60abe51eeb9650515431f0cf0e7b5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439464006957/6cd5fa42-76bc-4a89-b334-1fd989a1a5d2-460x259.jpeg\" alt=\"While They Watched\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Kirby holds up the damming UN report in a clip from the film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: While They Watched/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In hard-hitting scenes, the trailer combines images of the Kim family being cheered by adoring crowds cut with archival footage of a Nazi-era concentration camp. Later, black-and-white images show Adolf Hitler enjoying similar adoration.</p> <p>It uses news clips of the UN’s Michael Kirby, the chair of a commission on<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-united-nations\"> human rights in North Korea</a>, issuing stark warnings about the fate of the country’s citizens. Kirby’s report concluded that the government’s actions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-united-nations\">resembled those of Nazis </a>during the second world war, and the film follows this narrative. </p> <p>Smith knows that the comparison between North Korea and Nazi Germany is controversial. More than six million people were killed during the holocaust, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/torture-executions-rapes-north-korea-human-rights\">whereas estimates of the death toll</a> at the hands of the North Korean government range from 200,000 to 3 million since 1990s – with starvation playing a key role.</p> <p>He invited Kirby to appear in the film, but the Australian judge declined on the grounds that he had to stay impartial. </p> <h2>Countering apathy</h2> <p>Three governments come in for the most criticism: China, over its forced repatriation of North Koreans who cross the border illegally, South Korea, for ignoring the problem north of the border, and the DPRK itself.</p> <p>After living in South Korea, spending time with defectors and shadowing campaigners, Smith said he was surprised by how little southerners know, or care, about the plight of their neighbours. “It’s on the news but no one talks about it... people have little interest,” he said. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://en.asaninst.org/contents/south-korean-attitudes-toward-north-korea-and-reunification/\">A 2014 public opinion survey </a> found an increased level of detachment and apathy amongst young South Koreans about the situation facing people across the border. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>One of the stars of the film is Yeon-mi Park, a defector who has become an <a href=\"http://knowledge%2C%20later%20http//www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/oct/29/north-korean-defector-defy-regime-live-q-and-a.\">outspoken critic</a> of the country.

It’s not a question of a hidden agenda, he adds,<strong> </strong>“when they tell their stories I think they truly believe them”. </p> <p>The film will be shown to its main backers and supporters in Seoul tomorrow and is being submitted to the festival circuit in the UK later this year. Full details of the release will be available on the<a href=\"http://whiletheywatched.wix.com/film\"> film’s website</a>. <br /></p> <p>Smith and his team have also set up a campaign page assisting people in “immediately and effectively alleviate the suffering of the North Korean people”.

age of 58 from complications to gall-bladder surgery. Most artists are referred to by their proper but distancing surnames – Constable, Matisse – but he’s one of very few to achieve the ultimate signifier of fame, recognition on first-name terms (we might also allow “Vincent” in deference to Don McLean). Most of us could even manage a thumbnail sketch of the life: pop art, Studio 54, Mick and Bianca. Warhol was the notorious voyeur who shot sex tapes <em>avant la lettre</em>, albeit gussied up as art films, all the while insisting that he himself was a virgin – that’s when you could prise a word out of him beyond a “Gee!” or a “My!” He was the seven-stone weakling who hid from the world behind his platinum toupées and Ray-Bans. He was affectless, amoral, his campy work emerging haphazardly from the druggy haze of his studio, the Factory, where a miscellany of misfits and poor little rich kids crashed and burned while Warhol looked on with what John Updike called his “deadpan rapture”.</p> <p>That, at least, is the boilerplate biography. But after talking to many survivors of Warhol’s circle in New York, including his relatives as well as an associate who was close to the artist for many years but has never spoken at length before, I discovered a very different version of the man, a long way from the dead-eyed Martian of legend. And I came away with a renewed respect for his uncanny prescience in anticipating our fascination with brands, celebrity, even selfies. Warhol was the painter of modern life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce667da0ea709ec22dbcf73d40cc562e279462e5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439475654399/7c76dd7d-1223-437a-a994-dccdc87a6760-341x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Warhol was 'a long way from the dead-eyed Martian of legend'.\" width=\"341\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warhol was ‘a long way from the dead-eyed Martian of legend’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Unangst/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To start at the top, with Warhol’s crowning glory: it’s true that he was a great one for affecting ever bolder, and more unabashedly synthetic, confections as he grew accustomed to the spotlight. But the first time he wore a wig, it was out of a very human self-consciousness, after a nervous illness in his youth left his body completely hairless. With a flair for publicity which was characteristic and innate, Warhol eventually parlayed his baldness into a plus. According to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/1997/dec/21/fiction.williamburroughs\" title=\"\"> Victor Bockris</a>, an Englishman from Brighton who worked for Warhol at the Factory in the 1970s, Warhol realised that America didn’t know its artists. The generation who immediately preceded him were the abstract expressionists, scowling introspectives such as Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. They would only unburden themselves, if at all, to toney art critics, and even then in terms that lay readers might struggle to grasp. But Warhol, the man who turned the everyday of American life into art – dollar bills, soup cans, Brillo-pad boxes – pulled off the same trick in reverse, making an artificial or at least contrived version of “Andy Warhol” part of everyone’s scenery. “What did all Americans immediately get? Cartoons, comic strips,” Bockris said. “So Andy became a cartoon, the Donald Duck of art.” He wore the same things every day – leather jacket, black jeans, sneakers – ensuring that he leapt out of the paparazzi pictures in the <em>New York Post</em>. “And he looked after himself,” Bockris said. “Andy worked out. He went to the gym and lifted weights.”</p> <p>Andy Warhol worked out?!</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/04/biography.art\" title=\"\">John Richardson, the acclaimed biographer of Picasso</a>, compared Warhol to a “holy fool”, a figure associated with the eastern traditions of the remote sliver of land where the Warhol (originally Warhola) family hailed from, Carpathian Ruthenia in the former Austro-Hungarian empire. Warhol’s on-off friend Truman Capote called him “a Sphinx without a secret”. But his reputation for mute inscrutability isn’t altogether justified. Yes, it won him that priceless fascination that we reserve for the silent – Kate Moss, the Queen. Warhol let the praise and abuse heaped on his art and his person go without comment in public, but it was a different matter behind closed doors, according to his nephew, James Warhola. In his childhood, James and his brothers often stayed at their uncle’s townhouse on Lexington Avenue, a cabinet of curiosities, as he remembered it, with “carousel horses and cigar-store Indians”. A lithe and youthful 60, James has inherited something of the dreamy wonder of his famous relative. “When we were all together as a family, my mom would sometimes question Uncle Andy about his art. You know, ‘What’s that meant to be?’, or even ‘Why are you wasting your time on this?’ And he would give as good as he got – not in a hostile way, but saying that this was his work, it had value and importance for him. He had studied art and was very knowledgeable.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/01/jonas-mekas-avant-garde-film-interview\">Jonas Mekas: the man who inspired Andy Warhol to make films</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We were sitting in a pew at the Church of St Thomas More, a block or so from Andy’s old home. It was a slightly ersatz copy of an English parish church, the sodium lighting giving the interior an embalmed quality. “My uncle would sometimes bring us here,” James said. It in no way put Warhol off that his fellow worshippers included some of the most distinguished old-money families of Manhattan. But he came to church because he was faithful to the old religion of his mother country, Byzantine Catholicism (the Roman version was the next best thing, and more conveniently situated for Lexington Avenue). James said there were crucifixes in every room of his uncle’s house, including one above his (four-poster) bed. The first time Richardson called on Warhol at home, he was struck by “the gleam, the hush, and the peace of a presbytery”.</p> <p>The artist never talked about religion, any more than he did about anything else. But it’s often overlooked that he wrote half a dozen books, including a novel and some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/21/andy-warhol-diaries-pat-hackett\" title=\"\">1,200 pages of diaries</a>, admittedly with the help of ghostwriters (“he dictated every word of it himself”, Bockris pointed out). In fact, Warhol is perhaps the most quotable artist of all time, with a line on everything from his supposedly non-existent love life to his thoughts on everyday products. “What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.” Incidentally, it’s hard to read that paean to the downhome American values of apple pie and K-Mart as the ravings of a degenerate fag, as J Edgar Hoover might have put it. (The FBI boss once dispatched two of his men to the San Francisco film festival, to scrutinise Warhol’s allegedly subversive movie, <em>Lonesome Cowboys</em>, made in 1968. “There was no plot to the film and no development of characters,” noted the Feds.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d46dd025d77dc1d3733091a9e65e21c29933895\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/11/1439301639046/85fa952f-a57a-4d3e-99fd-1dd19aa01151-460x341.jpeg\" alt=\"A still from Andy Warhol's film Empire\" width=\"460\" height=\"341\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Andy Warhol’s film Empire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what about the films? There’s no doubt about the period shock value of Warhol’s <em>Blow Job</em> (1964), for example. Except the viewer only sees the lucky or otherwise recipient, a man by the name of DeVeren Bookwalter, from the waist up. Warhol liked to provoke, but what he really wanted was to be taken seriously by the big boys in Hollywood, and perhaps even to join them one day; to hear the name of the Factory uttered in the same breath as Universal and Warner Brothers.</p> <p>At his apartment in Brooklyn, the veteran film-maker Jonas Mekas and I spooled through rushes he shot back in the 70s and had never shown anyone before. On the magic lantern of his ancient Moviola screen, Andy Warhol sprang to life once more – brick-red polo-neck, slacks, wig. He was operating his movie camera on a beach at Cape Cod, filming a couple of boys playing rough and tumble. One of them was John Kennedy Jr, JFK’s son. Warhol is known for his awestruck, fan’s-eye-view silkscreen prints of John Jr’s mother, Jackie, but it’s forgotten now that this “freak” who hung out with junkies and losers was also a habitué of Camelot, JFK’s inner circle.</p> <p>Mekas, the 92-year-old doyen of New York’s underground film scene, was the first to screen Warhol’s releases, patiently lacing up mile upon mile of Warhol’s unblinking cinematography. He told me: “I don’t know about his art, but he is a genius of film.” Just as an old master picture shows us what paint can do, so<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/11/art.september11\" title=\"\"> Warhol’s fanatically unhurried cinema – <em>Empire</em> (1964)</a> consists of a single shot of the Empire State Building running to eight hours and five minutes – demonstrates to the viewer the penetrating insight of the camera. To those who can stick it out, that is. “At the premiere, I insisted that Andy must watch the film like everyone else. Because he is always so busy, he will go after some minutes.” Mekas produced a length of rope and ran it through his fingers. The still sinewy auteur began looping it around my chair. “So I tied him up – like this! Of course when I looked at Andy later, he had freed himself and he was gone.”</p> <p>What about Warhol’s relationships with others? According to art world lore, he looked on with a kind of glassy ecstasy at the self-harming antics of the low-lifes and bored heiresses who gravitated to his studio, some of whom met premature deaths.</p> <p>“Listen, those people would have been dead earlier if it wasn’t for Andy Warhol,” Mekas said. “He was the only one who would take them in. He was the perfect father – he didn’t judge people who had been judged and rejected by everybody else.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDULlMa8Hxc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jDULlMa8Hxc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>‘Baby’ Jane Holzer is referenced in Roxy Music’s ‘Virginia Plain’</figcaption> </figure>   <p>One person who’s in a position to know is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/nov/18/miami.usa.travelfoodanddrink\" title=\"\">“Baby” Jane Holzer</a>, one of Andy’s “superstars” – an actor who appeared in three of his movies and was a denizen of the Factory. The daughter of a real-estate investor, she married the heir to a New York property fortune. She was hymned by Roxy Music in their hit “Virginia Plain” (“Baby Jane’s in Acapulco / We are flying down to Rio”) and immortalised by Tom Wolfe as “The Girl of the Year” in his groundbreaking book of essays, <em>The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby</em>. Now a formidable art patron, Holzer still trails a hint of mischief behind her, like prom night perfume. We met at Bloomingdale’s, where the management had set an entire floor aside for their valued customer. She first ran into Warhol when she was shopping with David Bailey and Nicky Haslam, and the pair of them hailed Warhol across the street.</p> <p>Why did you hang out with him? “It was better than being a bored housewife,” she deadpans. What did he shop for? “Jewels, darling. He adored jewels.”</p> <p>Holzer was renowned for her sex appeal back in the day. Wasn’t she afraid of being hit on at the Factory? “Actually, I found it restful,” she said. “I would go there to sleep.”</p> <p>Factory insiders told me that far from being a den of iniquity, it was more like the art faculty at the University of Life. Joseph Freeman first attended aged 13, and was soon exposed to amphetamine-users injecting themselves “in the tush”. But to Little Joey, as he then was, a streetwise kid growing up just after the era of the Sharks and Jets of <em>West Side Story</em>, it was all so much water off a DA haircut. “It was one of the best times of my life.” These days, Freeman is a businessman leasing out kit to TV crews. He has seldom spoken of his days with Warhol. The unlikely pair bonded over a shared interest in hi-fi. “I was a dork and the dorky thing back then was taping. I saw Andy on the cover of my favourite hi-fi magazine and I knew I had to meet him,” Freeman said. It was his job to rouse Warhol and get him to work on time. “He was turning up at the Factory at 6pm. It was too late – people needed to see him, he had to take care of business.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>He loved talking on the phone ... He just seemed to understand what would make teenage boys kill themselves laughing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fortified by a breakfast of Cheerios, Warhol would hail a taxi, or at least try to. On a Lexington kerbside, Freeman mimed a frail dowager shooing wasps. “That’s why he needed me with him” – the pint-sized Joey would cajole or menace cabbies into pulling over. Freeman told me that he and a pal used to phone Warhol on Sunday mornings. “He was at home then and he loved talking on the phone. He’d talk for hours. We’d say: ‘What are you doing, Andy?’ and he’d say: ‘Oh, I’m sucking cock.’ I mean, we fell about.”</p> <p>That was hardly an appropriate thing to tell a 13-year-old boy. “I guess not. But he just seemed to understand what would make teenage boys kill themselves laughing.”</p> <p>Warhol appeared to be obsessed with other people’s sex lives, asking female friends about their dates and how well-endowed they were. But he wasn’t the frustrated virgin of his own myth-making. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/feb/14/artsfeatures.warhol\" title=\"\">John Giorno</a>, a poet and artist, was the star of his first film, <em>Sleep</em> (1963): five hours of the male lead catching zeds.</p> <p>“You’ve been described as Warhol’s ‘close friend’?”</p> <p>Giorno smiled. “Yes.”</p> <p>“But you were lovers?”</p> <p>“Yes.” Tall and distinguished, with a lived-in Roman face and a corona of white hair, Giorno spoke to me at his loft in the Bowery. It was once home to the trigger-happy writer William Burroughs, whose perforated firing-range targets still bared their stigmata on the walls. Giorno told me the most extraordinary and moving thing about Warhol. “You know, he had a beautiful body. He was taking diet pills – basically, speed – and he was working all the time, working with his hands, making the silkscreen prints, which is quite a physical job. So he was slim and he had really good muscle definition.

Needless to say he was a complicated and often combative man. It took an effort, strenuous at times, to remain a close friend; but it seemed to me worth putting in the time, allowing him to relax into his deeper self, which was actually quite shy, even solitary. The public mask didn’t fit the private man very well, and I was always much relieved when he took it off.</p> <p>Vidal would dwell at length on his feuds and fixed on the idea, which he took from Goethe, that talent is formed in stillness but character “in the stream of the world”. He entered that stream and swam vigorously, often against the current. And his wide knowledge of the world informed his work – the brilliant historical novels, especially <em>Burr</em> (about Aaron Burr, a founding father) and <em>Julian</em>, about the fourth-century Roman emperor. His seven novels about American history form an elegant and entertaining interlocking series that runs from the Jeffersonian years through the mid-20th century, and which puts his vast erudition on display in palatable ways. His essays, as gathered in <em>United States: Essays 1952-1992</em>, make up more than 1,000 pages of vivid writing about books and ideas – perhaps his main contribution to the republic of letters. His perspective is always that of the lofty intellectual. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-lahr\">John Lahr</a> once said, Vidal “pisses from an enormous height”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/02/lost-heart-of-political-debate-gore-vidal-william-f-buckley-best-of-enemies\">‘Don’t call me a crypto-Nazi!’ The lost heart of political debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A brilliant writer and public intellectual who could take on the world when he felt it necessary, Vidal was a brave figure on the political scene who would stand up for things that meant a lot to him, and he made his case eloquently before a wide audience. He was that nearly extinct variety of human being: a famous writer whose fame extended far beyond the realms of literature: a wit, a political pundit, a sought-after TV guest, a scold and much more. As he put it himself: “I am at heart a propagandist, a tremendous hater, a tiresome nag, complacently positive that there is no human problem that could not be solved if people would simply do as I advise.” That he was also a brilliant novelist and essayist was often beside the point.</p> <p>From the start of his career in the late 1940s, he looked around to see who else was getting attention, and it irked him when others seemed to outflank him. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/truman-capote\">Truman Capote</a> certainly annoyed him, and he honed his talent for feuding with this feline young novelist from the American south whose first novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/other-voices-other-rooms.html\"><em>Other Voices, Other Rooms</em></a>, swept the bestseller lists in 1948. That same year, Vidal’s first major novel, <em>The City and the Pillar</em>, arrived noisily on the scene; one of the first American novels with an explicitly gay theme, it turned Vidal into something of a pariah in the literary establishment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f891683ca3a8ecd1440fdc878e9f987f342cb919\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439459438648/2036472d-bfe3-43b2-9665-c2f83498f779-353x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Gore Vidal aged 21.

Photograph: Jerry Cooke/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vidal lived in New York after the war, as did Capote, and they moved in the same social circle, over which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tennesseewilliams\">Tennessee Williams</a> presided. “I first met Truman at Anaïs Nin’s apartment,” Vidal recalled. “My first impression – as I wasn’t wearing my glasses – was that it was a colourful ottoman. When I sat down on it, it squealed. It was Truman.”</p> <p>It annoyed Vidal horribly that when Life magazine ran an article on the new generation of writers it featured a large picture of Capote and a small one of Vidal. The two men quarrelled endlessly in those days, exchanging punches in the press over each other’s styles. Vidal accused Capote of imitating the prose of Carson McCullers with “a bit of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/oct/20/brief-history-short-story-eudora-welty\">Eudora Welty</a>” thrown in for good measure. Capote suggested that Vidal’s main literary influence was the New York Daily News. Overhearing this particular exchange, Williams rolled his eyes in mock horror: “Please! You are making your mother ill.”</p> <p>In 1948, Vidal travelled to Paris, where he met up with Williams and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/christopher-isherwood\">Christopher Isherwood</a>, and, the purpose of his visit, saw the elder statesman of world literature, André Gide, who had won the Nobel prize in literature the year before. Gide was at the peak of his fame, a public intellectual who represented, for Vidal, an ideal of sorts. Like Vidal, he considered homosexuality utterly natural, noting that it could be found in most of the advanced cultural moments in history. That Gide was also gay intrigued Vidal, and he gratefully accepted from the 79-year-old writer an inscribed copy of <em>Corydon</em>, a volume of four dialogues on homosexuality.</p> <p>The young writer admired Gide’s severe manner, recalling his large bald head with a dent above the brow, skin like rice paper and eyes that glistened with a combination of “lust and intelligence”. Gide smoked, talking in mandarin French about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/oscar-wilde\">Oscar Wilde</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/henryjames\">Henry James</a> as if he were giving a lecture. When Vidal heard that Capote had been there only a couple of days previously, he nervously asked the old master how he found him. “Who?” asked Gide. Then he remembered that there was a young American author by that name and found on his desk the article from Life that featured Capote. Unsurprisingly, the young Vidal winced.</p> <p>The novelist and composer Paul Bowles was a friend of both Capote and Vidal, who decided to join him in Morocco in the summer of 1949. When Bowles explained that Capote planned to come as well, Vidal cooked up a practical joke. He thought it would be amusing for Capote to step off the boat and see Bowles with Vidal at his side. And the scenario played out nicely. When Bowles met Capote at the dock, Capote looked behind him to see Vidal with his hands in his jacket pockets, as if in permanent residence. Capote’s face fell “like a souffle that had been stuck into a freezer”, a French diplomat who happened to be there at the time recalled.</p> <p>Theirs was a minor squabble, with neither side missing a chance to make a joke about the other. But the feud expanded in the 60s, after Vidal had been – according to Capote, in an interview with Playgirl – tossed out of the White House by Bobby Kennedy because he was “drunk and obnoxious”. In fact Kennedy had taken offence at Vidal’s apparent intimacy with Jacqueline Kennedy – the first lady was distantly related to Vidal by marriage – and the writer had left in a huff. Vidal sued Capote over the remark, and Capote countersued. The legal case dragged on with Vidal winning in the end, though Capote had no money by then, so it was a Pyrrhic victory.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6qW-ZKxZss\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6qW-ZKxZss?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Best of Enemies official trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Their wrangling continued until Capote, ill from his abuse of alcohol and prescription drugs, died in the late summer of 1984. When Vidal’s editor called from New York with news of his rival’s death, Vidal remarked after the briefest pause: “A wise career move.”</p> <p>Vidal and Norman Mailer first met at a mutual friend’s Manhattan apartment in 1952. Mailer had made a huge splash with <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/naked-and-the-dead.html\"><em>The Naked and the Dead</em></a>, his bestselling novel of the Pacific war, frustrating Vidal, whose own war novel, <em>Williwaw</em>, had barely registered. The two young writers circled each other warily, and a complicated friendship began that would play out over the next five decades. The two had little in common. “Norman imagined himself by nature a kind of boxer – though he wasn’t, not really,” says Gay Talese, a friend to both men. “In reality, Norman was soft. But he put on this aggressive mask. Vidal had another kind of mask: cool, suave, worldly-wise. It was a good contrast with Norman. They played well together, but it was always a kind of act. They both understood the publicity value of this contest, and they let it play out in different ways.”</p> <p>The real trouble started in 1971, when Vidal chose to review Mailer’s incendiary book about the feminist movement, <em>The Prisoner of Sex</em>. He dismissed Mailer, combining him with two other macho men, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/henry-miller\">Henry Miller</a> and the murderer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charles-manson\">Charles Manson</a>, to create a single male aggressor and sexist pig he called “M3”. Vidal wrote: “Women are not going to make it until M3 is reformed, and that is going to take a long time.”</p> <p>Needless to say, Mailer didn’t enjoy being compared to the likes of Manson. Never, by his own admission, one to pass up the opportunity to be on television, Vidal accepted an offer from Dick Cavett to appear on his talk show with Mailer. In the green room, according to Mailer, Vidal put a warm hand on the back of his neck, a gesture that he interpreted as veiled aggression. Mailer answered with a not-so playful swipe on the cheek. Much to Mailer’s surprise, Vidal slapped him back. Then Mailer leaned forward like a boxer and, in a move that suggested to Vidal he had been drinking, winked before headbutting his cheek.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Mailer leaned forward like a boxer and winked before butting his head into Vidal’s cheek</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the show, Mailer expressed his disapproval of Vidal, saying he was intellectually shameless. Somewhat clumsily, he described Vidal’s writing as “no more interesting than the stomach of an intellectual cow”. Vidal ignored him, offering an innocent smile. But Mailer attacked again, asking him why he didn’t, for once, speak to him directly instead of talking to the audience. Then he attacked Vidal for alluding to the fact that Mailer had stabbed his wife in 1960, calling him “a liar and a hypocrite”. Vidal didn’t flinch. Instead, he remained eerily calm when Mailer asked him to apologise for comparing him to Manson. “I would apologise if – if it hurts your feelings, of course I would,” said Vidal. Mailer replied: “No, it hurts my sense of intellectual pollution.” Vidal smiled serenely. “Well,” he said, “I must say that as an expert, you should know about such things.” The conversation grew ever more hostile, but – as anyone who watches a clip of this broadcast will notice – Vidal never lost control of himself. On the other hand, Mailer came off as a bully.</p> <p>The two avoided each other for some years, but their rivalry came to a head in 1977, when Vidal and his partner, Howard Austen, were passing through New York. “Howard adored New York,” said Vidal. “I never did. It has all of the filth and confusion of Calcutta without the cultural amenities.”</p> <p>One night they attended a party for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/princessmargaret\">Princess Margaret</a>, before going on to an expansive apartment owned by Lally Weymouth, a journalist and daughter of Katherine Graham, publisher of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post\">the Washington Post</a>. More than 100 guests crammed together. “You could hardly breathe,” Austen recalled, “everyone standing shoulder to shoulder.” It was a glittering affair, with Mailer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jackie-onassis\">Jackie Kennedy Onassis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/may/01/guardianobituaries.usa\">JK Galbraith</a>, Gay Talese, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/william-styron\">William Styron</a> and Jerry Brown – Vidal’s future rival for a senate seat in California – among the guests.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8m9vDRe8fw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8m9vDRe8fw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer on the Dick Cavett Show</figcaption> </figure>   <p>What happened next varies according to the teller, but Austen’s version accords with that of others:</p> <p>[Mailer] saw Gore surrounded by friends, everyone talking and laughing. Gore was in a good mood as Mailer moved right up to him, got in his face, and everybody around them fell pretty silent. It looked like trouble. Norman told Gore that he looked like an old Jew, and Gore shook his head. He didn’t want to get into anything with Norman. Then Mailer threw his drink in Gore’s face, right in his eyes, then hit him in the mouth with a punch, a kind of glancing uppercut. Gore was stunned, and he stepped back. He wiped a dribble of blood from his mouth with a handkerchief. Then Gore said, ‘Norman, once again words have failed you.’</p> <p>This confrontation at Weymouth’s apartment became emblematic of an age when literary lions roared at each other. “It was all very tedious,” said Vidal, referring to the encounter as “the night of the small fists”. For his part, Mailer had another version, as he wrote to a friend: “I butted him, threw the gin and tonic in his face, and bounced the glass off his head. It was just enough to prime you or me for a half-hour war, but Vidal must have thought it was the second battle of Stalingrad for he never made a move when I invited him downstairs. Twenty-four hours later he was telling everybody he had pushed me across the room.”</p> <p>In 1984, Mailer decided to call a truce, inviting Vidal to participate with him in a fundraising event in New York. “Our feud, whatever its roots for each of us,” he wrote to Vidal, “has become a luxury. It’s possible in years to come that we’ll both have to be manning the same sinking boat at the same time. Apart from that, I’d still like to make up. An element in me, absolutely immune to weather and tides, runs independently fond of you.”</p> <p>Vidal said, “I never actually disliked Norman, not really. So now the feud – for what it was worth – was officially over. This was fine with me, as long as I didn’t have to read another of his books.” The pair would do several fundraising events in their last decade, and the truce held.</p> <p>This was never the case with William F Buckley, who was Satan as far as Vidal was concerned: a vicious rightwing polemicist who represented everything that was wrong with American society. Buckley was the quintessential US conservative of a certain stripe: Roman Catholic, Ivy League-educated, wealthy, with a mid-Atlantic accent that seemed to parody itself at times. He founded the National Review, a conservative magazine, in 1955 and used it as a platform to make himself the spokesman for laissez-faire, pro-business economics and a hard-nosed, anti-communist foreign policy. With his first book, a feisty memoir called <em>God and Man at Yale </em>(1951), he had laid down the gauntlet, helping to set in motion the movement that eventually led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ronald-reagan\">Ronald Reagan</a>’s presidency.</p> <p>To his credit, Buckley and his circle did a good job in the 50s and early 60s of distancing themselves from segregationist and antisemitic voices in the American conservative movement. Buckley disliked the libertarian novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ayn-rand\">Ayn Rand</a> (an atheist) as well as Governor George Wallace (an obvious racist, in his view). Much like Vidal, he had denounced the John Birch Society, an extremist rightwing organisation, as representing a dangerous turn in American political thinking.</p> <p>Vidal would never accept that he and Buckley had anything in common. But they shared a similar background, with roots in the south – Vidal’s grandfather, a powerful US senator, came from Mississippi, and Buckley’s father had struck it rich as an oil man in Texas. While they took opposing stances on many aspects of foreign and domestic policy, they shared more than either would admit.</p> <p>Their most infamous confrontation came in 1968, events now captured in the feature-length documentary film <em>Best of Enemies</em>. A few months prior to the presidential nominating conventions that year, Vidal was asked to appear in a series of 10 prime-time television debates with Buckley, moderated by Howard K Smith, one of the most respected journalists in the country. This promised to be the intellectual and political fight of the decade, and Vidal took it very seriously. “He was like a prize fighter getting ready for the big fight,” recalled Austen. In his hotel suite, Vidal made elaborate notes on hot topics such as the Vietnam war, housing for the poor and the constitutional rights of assembly for protest. He knew Buckley would come well-armed with statistics and Jesuitical arguments, and planned to fire back with everything he could muster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74c81bba5c1f59105a69160fcc7ff9c0f00c91e9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439382772439/a7076d28-b617-45d7-95a2-8c114f7c8ad2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gore Vidal with Bianca Jagger in 1979.

Photograph: Fotos International/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s important to recall the historical context. The Vietnam war had taken a turn for the worse and President Johnson had stepped up the draft, calling for 48,000 new soldiers, a move that inflamed the college-age generation in the US, creating resistance on a scale that nobody in Washington could have foreseen. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king\">Martin Luther King, Jr</a> had been assassinated in Memphis in April, Bobby Kennedy in Los Angeles in June. “We had always been a violent country,” Vidal said, “these deaths confirmed what we knew already.”</p> <p>The Buckley-Vidal debates attracted 10 million viewers for each session and the saturation coverage turned both men into celebrities. From the outset, the tension between the opponents was clear. Buckley’s manner was pompous, with his tongue flicking, his eyes leering. Vidal was only slightly less pompous, with affectations and mannerisms that seemed, even to his friends, over the top and perhaps out of character.</p> <p>Buckley attacked Vidal for spending much of the year in Europe, implying that he was a traitor because he lived in Rome. By the third debate, Buckley had begun to mock Vidal’s popular if scandalous sex-change novel <em>Myra Breckinridge</em>, which he described as pornography. Vidal hit back hard: “If there were a contest for Mr Breckinridge, you would unquestionably win it. I based her style polemically on you – passionate but irrelevant.” He referred to Buckley as “the Marie Antoinette of the right wing”, someone who wished to impose his own “bloodthirsty neurosis” on American politics. Allusions to homosexuality were abundant, with Buckley implying that Vidal was distinctly “other”; Vidal insinuated that Buckley was a closet queen.</p> <p>The real fight began in Chicago, where the last debates took place. More than 10,000 demonstrators belonging to various student movements converged, despite the refusal of the mayor, Richard Daley, to allow permits. As Vidal saw it, this abrogated the “right to assembly” as put forward in the constitution. On 28 August, the day of the seventh debate, there had been a “police riot”, as it was described in the subsequent Walker Report. A young protester had lowered the American flag in Grant Park, and the police swarmed. Tear gas filled the air, and clubs swung. The nation watched in horror, as the United States appeared to slip into anarchy.</p> <p>The evening debate contained fireworks of a kind never before seen on prime-time American television. Buckley spoke for the older generation when he decried the lawlessness in the streets. He exuded patriotism. When asked by Smith if raising a Viet Cong flag in the midst of the Vietnam war was unduly provocative, Buckley nodded, saying it was like raising a Nazi flag in the US during the second world war. Vidal shook his head, referring again and again to the “right to assembly”. “What are we doing in Vietnam if you can’t freely express yourself in the streets of Chicago?” he wondered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"269b24f76f5e1754a10a56c7b134a3eaa169a147\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439382488415/ae21a25d-46af-4dac-b2c5-b74138c53bed-460x420.jpeg\" alt=\"President John F Kennedy with Gore Vidal\" width=\"460\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President John F Kennedy with Gore Vidal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He talked about the repressive treatment of protesters, alluding to the riots on the streets outside the convention centre. Buckley interrupted him, recalling the time George Lincoln Rockwell, a leader of the American Nazi Party, had marched with his followers into a small town in Illinois. They had been turned away, and Buckley thought this had been justified by the unusual circumstances. Taking the cue, Vidal jabbed at Buckley: “As far as I’m concerned, the only pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself.” It was a deadly assertion, and Buckley curled his lip and sneered: “Now listen, you queer! Stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I’ll sock you in your goddamn face and you’ll stay plastered.”</p> <p>Responding to an interviewer the next day, Vidal said: “I’ve always tried to treat Buckley like the great lady that he is.” Not surprisingly, three years of law suits and countersuits followed, with no clear victory for either man. After Buckley’s death, Vidal wrote a caustic obituary of his old enemy which ended: “RIP – WFB – in hell.”</p> <p>A later feud involved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopherhitchens\">Christopher Hitchens</a>, the English journalist and flamethrower who, in his early days as a leftwing polemicist, modelled himself partly on Vidal. “He wants to be me,” Vidal would often say, once designating Hitchens, whom he affectionately called Hitchy-Poo or, more often, The Poo, as his successor. In a witty counter-move, Hitchens printed some words by Vidal on the cover of his memoir, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hitch-22.html\"><em>Hitch-22</em></a>: “I have been asked whether I wish to nominate a successor, an inheritor, a dauphin or delfino. I have decided to name Christopher Hitchens.” The quotation is crossed out, with a handwritten note beside it: “No. CH.”</p> <p>As a young man, Hitchens seemed to relish the role of Vidal-come-lately, wasting no opportunity to appear on TV or comment on any political development. He drank booze in quantities even Vidal found excessive. From the outset, he had been suitably anti-establishment and anti-religious in ways that pleased Vidal, who spoke of him with admiration. When Hitchens attacked Henry Kissinger or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/mother-teresa\">Mother Teresa</a>, Vidal applauded, although he told me “He will always be Vidal-minor”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>That Christopher Hitchens supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was, for Vidal, beyond the pale</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then Hitchens moved to Washington, DC, and – according to Vidal – he “fell among thieves”. That Hitchens supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was, for Vidal, beyond the pale. Vidal had written several bestselling pamphlets against George W Bush and his gang in the years after 9/11, and had made himself vividly relevant in old age as a defiant critic of the White House and its brutal warmongering. Quite rightly, he predicted that the overthrow of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/saddam-hussein\">Saddam Hussein</a> would lead to chaos in the Middle East.</p> <p>“He’s gone mad, our Poo,” he said to me one evening in the winter of 2010, after Hitchens published a nasty piece about him in Vanity Fair called “Vidal Loco”. Hichens criticised Vidal’s three post-9/11 pamphlets, calling them “half-argued and half-written shock pieces”. He also attacked him for giving an interview in which he railed against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-bush\">George Bush</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dick-cheney\">Dick Cheney</a>, saying “the whole American experiment can now be regarded as a failure”. Hitchens seemed especially irritated when Vidal said of Britain: “This isn’t a country, it’s an American aircraft carrier.”</p> <p>On 2 October, 2010, not long after Hitchens was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, I spoke to him at a book festival in Pennsylvania. He was already fragile. We sat together in his hotel room and talked, and he asked me as I left if Vidal had spoken about him recently. I could not tell him the truth. “He wasn’t happy with your piece about him in Vanity Fair,” I said, “but he still thinks of you fondly.” Hitchens smiled, saying: “I looked to him as a model. We all did.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Line break\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;http://assets.guim.co.uk/stylesheets/webfonts.d35b9e8c33865a46b3231a20c9f960b0.css&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/assets/stylesheets/factbox2.css&quot;&gt;&lt;base href=&quot;.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;   &lt;style&gt; html {margin-top: 24px;} body {background-color: #fff;} .wrapper{ margin: 10px 0; border-top: 3px solid #951c55; width: 100%; background-color: #fff; height: 1px;} &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sex, looks and lawsuits - </strong>Gore Vidal in quotes</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Class is the most difficult subject for American writers to deal with and the most difficult for the English to avoid.”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A narcissist is someone better-looking than you are.”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Half of the American people have never read a newspaper.

for this 2008 comedy, according to producer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/juddapatow\" title=\"\">Judd Apatow</a> , was Floyd, the stoner played by Brad Pitt in <em>True Romance</em>: “I thought it would be funny to follow that character out of his apartment and watch him get chased by bad guys.” Seth Rogen plays Dale, James Franco is his dealer, Saul Silver, who has a rare new strain of marijuana, pineapple express. “It’s almost a shame to smoke it,” says Saul. “It’s like killing a unicorn. With, like, a bomb.” The movie was a massive hit, even inspiring the creation of a real variety of weed called pineapple express.</p> <h2>2 | Nancy Botwin<br /><strong>… from Weeds</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03f9dd81d81561b121904c5433836dbe659341bd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439383572450/6891da0b-c929-45a0-9356-25eb5d109710-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\"Mary-Louise Parker as Nancy Botwin in Weeds.\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woman who tokes: Mary-Louise Parker as Nancy Botwin in Weeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Sky One</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There’s a strange absence of great female stoners in culture, though that is being rectified now somewhat by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/14/broad-city-stoner-comedy-central-girls\" title=\"\">Comedy Central’s <em>Broad City</em></a>, written by and starring Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson.

Charles Baudelaire, 1821-1867.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Etienne Carjat/Apic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 19th-century French poet is one of the great chroniclers of drug use and his memoir <em>Artificial Paradises</em> features a detailed analysis of hashish. He was a member, along with other influential Parisian authors Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/human-comedy-balzac-review-nicholas-lezard\" title=\"\">Honoré de Balzac</a>, of Club des Hachichins (Hashish-Eaters’ Club), which met regularly between 1844 and 1849. “At first, a certain absurd, irresistible hilarity overcomes you,” he noted of their experiments. But, surprisingly, although far from strait-laced – he smoked opium and drank very heavily – Baudelaire was unconvinced by the appeal of hashish. It boosted creativity, he found, but artists risked becoming too dependent on it.</p> <h2>4 | David Wooderson<br /><strong>… from Dazed and Confused</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"341d8d69e6042da53e8d1fdbcd47ef68b43e894a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439383886413/d0eb8873-ef09-4cc6-89ee-4f8471d9e78d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Matthew McConaughey as David Wooderson in Dazed and Confused.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I get older, they stay the same age’: Matthew McConaughey as David Wooderson in Dazed and Confused.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Set in suburban Texas in the summer of 1976, on the last day of school, Richard Linklater’s 1993 movie had the tagline: “A time they’d never forget (if only they could remember).” It had a ridiculous ensemble cast (Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, an uncredited Renée Zellweger, all unknowns) but the standout performance is from a young Matthew McConaughey as Wooderson, a twentysomething guru still hanging with high-school kids. Pink jeans, Ted Nugent T-shirt, always stoned, driving his beloved hot rod and chasing redheads – every small town has a Wooderson. As he says: “I get older, they stay the same age.”</p> <h2>5 | <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg\" title=\"\">Snoop Dogg</a><br /><strong>Rapper</strong><br /></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciF8xyD2Tj4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ciF8xyD2Tj4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Encyclopedic knowledge: Snoop Dogg as Huggy Bear in Starsky and Hutch.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Snoop Dogg could feature in this list as an individual or for his music, or even for his film roles.

Danny, as played by shaggy-haired, dead-eyed Ralph Brown, is slow-talking and occasionally menacing. Mostly, he makes only partial sense, but he sums up the already-nostalgic mood of the film, set in the last days of 1969, when he complains: “They’re selling hippie wigs in Woolworths, man.”</p> <h2>7 | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnHaTlI1p7o\" title=\"\">Carl Spackler</a> <br /><strong>… from Caddyshack</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11fe168e8f4a35585dfc01a51283027af9ed38a5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439384421136/1a105b6d-5bfd-4a2e-b23e-0a6bfc6be3b9-460x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Amazing stuff: Bill Murray as stoner greenskeeper Carl Spackler in Caddyshack.\" width=\"460\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazing stuff: Bill Murray as stoner greenskeeper Carl Spackler in Caddyshack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orion/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/dec/05/bill-murray-five-best-moments-st-vincent\" title=\"\">Bill Murray (deranged greenkeeper Carl Spackler)</a> and <a href=\"http://img2-2.timeinc.net/ew/i/2012/02/23/Caddyshack-chevy-chase_610.jpg\" title=\"\">Chevy Chase (Ty Webb, aristo golfer)</a> share one scene in the 1980 comedy <em>Caddyshack</em>.

Spackler shows him a strain of grass he’s invented: a hybrid of bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, featherbed bent and northern California sensemilia. “The amazing stuff about this,” he says, “is that you can play 36 holes on it in the afternoon, take it home and just get stoned to the bejeezus-belt that night on this stuff.”</p> <h2>8 | Ulises Lima and Arturo Belano<br /><strong>The Savage Detectives</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3ffd4114b7b348a984e21169756eca6da9df3432\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439384593545/eabd7247-240d-40a4-9ac0-60444b070715-274x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Roberto Bolano's novel The Savage Detectives.\" width=\"274\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <em>New York Times</em> once claimed that Roberto Bolaño, the Chilean poet and author who died in 2003, aged 50, was addicted to heroin. The accusation was strongly contested by his wife and his agent. Either way, his novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/11/roberto-bolano-2666\" title=\"\"><em>The Savage Detectives</em></a> – typically considered his masterpiece – can be seen as a modest contribution to stoner literature. The main characters are Lima and Belano, two shambling poets in Mexico City who fund a literary magazine, <em>Lee Harvey Oswald</em>, by trafficking an expensive marijuana called Acapulco gold; they seem to partake themselves, too, especially Belano, who is an alter ego of Bolaño’s. “They weren’t writers,” one of the 50-odd narrators in <em>The Savage Detectives</em> notes. “Sometimes they wrote poetry, but I don’t think they were poets, either. They sold drugs.”</p> <h2>9 | Grace Trevethyn<br /><strong>… from Saving Grace</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0d8432af8693d32290d58d8ef63ddcd9e0f4f12\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439384758170/c65ddbce-7817-4bfa-9561-1a1282414330-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson in Saving Grace.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pot plants?

in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson ended their working relationship with a handshake; in Fantastic Four, Miles Teller and Kate Mara kept their flirtation to a brief glance or two; in Spy, Melissa McCarthy’s crush on Jude Law remained unrequited and in Avengers: Age of Ultron, fear over Mark Ruffalo’s potential predilection for angry sex rendered nights in with Scarlett Johansson a frightening impossibility.</p> <p>If you were looking for a side order of swoon with your stunts, you’ll have left the cinema in a curiously unaroused state. Even the films featuring a small glimmer of romance have been a cold shower in comparison to previous summers (barely there subplots from Ant-Man and Terminator Genisys and an underwritten dynamic in Jurassic World). </p> <p>This summer didn’t even offer up an action-centric romance in the vein of Knight and Day, Mr &amp; Mrs Smith, This Means War or The Tourist. Which, yes, isn’t exactly a bad thing but it helped to make for a curiously asexual season at the cinema.</p> <p>An injection of romance into a special effects-heavy blockbuster was typically seen as a way of appealing to the stereotypical idea of the female viewer who would be completely bored by any plot that didn’t involve kissing (women, eh?). But this shift towards the construction of a crowd-pleaser that doesn’t feel the need to crowbar in a superfluous love story implies that Hollywood is heading for a more balanced playing field.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cdfbd63576a07ace4716fa4f60f339fd83eb17c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439389963075/6dac4d6d-393e-45fb-afda-374e1ed947fb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Missionary: Impossible ...

Rebecca Ferguson’s role in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation gave her the opportunity to fight, double-cross and even save Tom Cruise from near death and yet, for the first time in an Ethan Hunt adventure, there wasn’t a shred of romance. In a film that was largely forgettable, the briskly efficient working relationship between the pair was a refreshing change. </p> <p>Charlize Theron was inarguably the driving force, quite literally, behind the action in Mad Max: Fury Road, with Tom Hardy merely along for the ride, a smart and daring subversion of the franchise-associated expectations. Her motivation (to save a band of oppressed women) was paramount above all else and again, her male co-star was a colleague of sorts, rather than a love interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57f1929b2f1061f6b9fb6a0539e366e4b2eda94e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/12/1439393691969/943ac7aa-acb4-4035-bcf1-b70440ccefa1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"No Hulk smash ...

The reason? Fear over his superpower, aka the more important focus of the film, getting in the way. Again, business trumps pleasure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/28/american-hustle-how-hollywood-rips-off-women-actors-sexism\">The real Hollywood scandal: why Jennifer Lawrence, Angelina Jolie and other female stars get ripped off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>George Clooney’s sci-fi flop Tomorrowland might have been largely tiresome but it did manage to avoid lazily pairing lead Britt Robertson with someone to smooch. Co-writer Damon Lindelof spoke about the decision to avoid this cliche. </p> <p>“If you have a female lead, people suddenly go, ‘Oh, there has to be a romantic entanglement’,” he told <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/george-clooney-on-tomorrowland-and-his-haters.html\">Vulture</a>. “So Brad [Bird] and I thought, What if she doesn’t get distracted by romantic entanglements? What if her ‘romance’ is with the future? It’ll be nice in 10 or 15 years for this not to be a thing anymore.”</p> <p>Maybe we’re almost there? The monstrous success of The Hunger Games franchise ($2.3bn and counting at the worldwide box office) taught Hollywood an important lesson: love isn’t all you need. While Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss did find herself in a boy triangle of sorts, it was so superfluous to her main objective, that it barely registered at all. Her priority is freeing the people, not falling in love and the fact that this could then be a profitable dynamic for studio Lionsgate sends a message to the industry.</p> <p>The terse, down-to-business relationships at the heart of this summer’s films aren’t necessarily reflective of the industry at large (this spring’s hits: the desperately archaic Cinderella and worryingly sexist Fifty Shades of Grey prove that) but it’s a beacon of hope in a season lacking in originality. That’s not to say there isn’t a place for romance (last summer’s Guardians of the Galaxy excelled by ensuring that Zoe Saldana was as integral to the plot as Chris Pratt) but forcing a ring on it, just to tick a box, is hopefully becoming a thing of the past.</p> <p>At least until the next reboot ...</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Benjamin Lee</strong>: There’s a curious lack of romance in Hollywood this year, with everyone from Ethan Hunt to Mad Max going out of their way to avoid a snog.

<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/a-most-wanted-man-review-philip-seymour-hoffman\">A Most Wanted Man</a> centres on a mid-1950s journey from Los Angeles to New York, and on to Dean’s childhood home in Indiana, during which the photographer captured iconic images of the up-and-coming actor for Life magazine.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\"

trailer shows us Pattinson’s attempts to convince his boss at Magnum photo agency (Joel Edgerton) that Dean is a future star – the Life photographs were taken before the release of the actor’s 1955 breakthrough in East of Eden. Ben Kingsley, as the legendarily tough Warner Bros studio head Jack Warner, tells Dean that he needs to follow the rules if he wants to be famous.</p> <p>The footage is intended to revive a project that failed to impress critics at the Berlin film festival earlier this year. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/09/berlin-2015-life-review-anton-corbijn-james-dean\">called the biopic</a> “worryingly and ironically lifeless”, adding: “It’s a laborious, lugubrious movie maintained at a somnolent cool-jazz tempo – a waxworky piece of American icon worship featuring a sympathetic but mannered performance from Dane DeHaan impersonating James Dean ... This is a movie about photographs and photography, a subject about which Corbijn knows perhaps more than any movie director working. But the subject arguably made him self-conscious. At any rate, the film has the inert stasis of a photo spread.”</p> <p>Dean died in a car crash in September 1955 while travelling at a reported 85mph in his new Porsche 550 Spyder. At the time, cinemagoers knew him only for East of Eden, though the actor subsequently became better known for Rebel Without a Cause when it was released a few months later. The Life magazine photographs taken by Stock formed an important part of the star’s legacy.</p> <p>Corbijn is known for his own iconic late 70s images of Joy Division, whose singer Ian Curtis also died at a young age. The Dutchman, 60, rose to fame as a film-maker in 2007 (after a career spent mostly working on music videos) with the biopic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/may/18/cannes2007.cannesfilmfestival1\">Control</a>, which borrowed the famous look of his own early pictures of the band to paint a taciturn, monochrome picture of the final years of Curtis’s life.

The first movie, tentatively titled Heidi – Queen of the Mountains, is expected to hit cinemas in mid 2016. Written by Paul Watson and produced by Big Tree’s Simon Wright, it will be shot on location in the Swiss Alps later this year.</p> <p>“We are very excited about working on bringing to life one of the children’s best classics along with Simon and Paul,” said Vistaar managing director Sheetal Vinod Talwar in a statement. “We believe that this will be a film that will allow audiences to relive this classic and this adaptation will allow the new generation of children to fall in love with the character all over.”</p> <p>Spyri’s 1881 novel Heidi is one of the bestselling children’s books of all time and is considered a classic of Swiss literature. It tells how the orphaned young girl is sent to live with her curmudgeonly grandfather in the Swiss alps, where the pair learn to love each others’ company and Heidi befriends a local goatherd named Peter. Later, the child is sent to be a companion to an invalid child in Frankfurt but begins to pine for her personal Alpine utopia and is eventually allowed to return home. </p> <p>The book, originally published in two parts, has been adapted dozens of times for film and television. The best known big screen iteration is the 1937 Hollywood version, starring Shirley Temple as Heidi. A 2005 version featured Max Von Sydow as Grandfather, Emma Bolger as Heidi and Diana Rigg as Grandmamma. A separate German language version was recently filmed by France’s StudioCanal and is due to hit cinemas in December.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The much-loved children’s fiction character is heading back to the big screen in a new set of three films","headline":"Swiss literary heroine Heidi set for new film trilogy","byline":"Ben Child","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/14/1439538138547/db36ea10-d717-4a46-9ac0-08c151215cbd-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-17T08:00:00+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The much-loved children’s fiction character is heading back to the big screen in a new set of three films</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/14/swiss-literary-heroine-heidi-set-for-new-film-trilogy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/aug/14/swiss-literary-heroine-heidi-set-for-new-film-trilogy","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/19/1426761348767/Ben-Child.jpg","firstName":"ben","lastName":"child","twitterHandle":"BenChildGeek","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a Guardian film writer and the blogger behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/week-in-geek\">The Week in Geek</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}]},{"id":"film/filmblog/2015/aug/14/bryan-cranston-fights-the-hollywood-blacklist-in-first-trailer-for-trumbo","elements":[{"id":"60f63221670d3fc773ef792be0f24e3f19bb2236","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439467651002/7e11de53-2120-4651-aaab-90b7bda250fb-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439467651002/7e11de53-2120-4651-aaab-90b7bda250fb-220x132.jpeg","source":"AP","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Breaking away ...

So it comes as something as a shock that the first trailer for Jay Roach’s Trumbo, starring Breaking Bad’s Bryan Cranston as the real-life blacklisted Oscar-winning screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/18/bryan-cranston-dalton-trumbo-biopic-2016-oscars\">Dalton Trumbo</a>, hints at a rousing and upbeat tale of rebellious film-making spirits with lively comedy notes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0dZ_2ICpJE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n0dZ_2ICpJE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Cranston is a freewheeling, cocksure force of nature as the writer, who found himself persona non grata in Hollywood as a result of the purge on supposed communist sympathisers that ran from the late 1940s to the late 1950s. Helen Mirren is the notorious anti-red Los Angeles Times Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, who’s out to make his life a misery, with John Goodman in full Walter Sobchak mode as the desk-smashing Hollywood producer Frank King, whose King Brothers Productions hired Trumbo, despite the fact that he’d been blacklisted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/18/bryan-cranston-dalton-trumbo-biopic-2016-oscars\">Bryan Cranston-led Dalton Trumbo biopic pitched for 2016 Oscars run</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We even get to see Kirk Douglas – as played by The Hobbit’s Dean O’Gorman, who appears to have a mouth full of cotton wool. It was Douglas, along with director Otto Preminger, who helped extract Trumbo from movie-making purgatory by naming him as the true screenwriter of Spartacus (1960).

Flash, pout, flash, over-the-shoulder pout, flash, removing a black leather glove. She called herself Vanessa but she was born Peter Davies. Although everyone came to call her Troy.</p> <p>Directed by Richard Lowenstein and Lynn-Maree Milburn, Ecco Homo is a documentary about the life of the artist and performer, which premieres at Melbourne film festival. The pair started working on the film in 2003, before their acclaimed documentaries about Father Bob Maguire (In Bob We Trust<em>)</em> and the Birthday Party musician Rowland S Howard (Autoluminescent).</p> <p>Davies’ voyage from the suburbs is told through a montage of those original photo booth shots and mixed-format moving imagery. The timeline of his life is underscored by the progress of technology, from VHS, to mini DV, to digital video, which Troy used for his video diaries, bringing to life his inner world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/29/melbourne-film-festival-youll-laugh-youll-cry-with-top-10-things-to-see-and-do\">Melbourne film festival: you'll laugh, you'll cry with top 10 things to see and do</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nobody fully understood that inner world. In various incarnations, Davies was a man, a woman, an artist, a fashion designer, a pop star and a muse. Most of all he appeared to be different things to different people, free and easy with confabulation. </p> <p>“Troy was a remarkable pioneer in the field of freedom of sexual expression,” says Milburn, explaining their desire to make such an intricate film. “He dealt with life with razor-sharp wit. He carried a dark secret, yet he never acted as a victim.”</p> <p>The embodiment of contradiction, Davies had once been a skinhead in the West Side Sharps gang, while moonlighting as a prostitute. Later in his teens he became one of the first contenders for gender reassignment and underwent three years of psychological testing before being accepted for surgery. But then he changed his mind. “The last two years were for art’s sake,” he said later. </p> <p>Davies recast himself as a bovver-boy auteur, working on videos for U2 and INXS, often gravitating in front of the camera. He enjoyed fleeting pop stardom himself, through his band Ecco Homo. In the clip for their song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPGNxgIjqr4\">Motorcycle Baby</a> he’s wrapped around INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, wearing a blonde wig and winged shades. </p> <p>Later there was his electro single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNvE-uWbEkM\">New York, New York</a>, with a guest appearance by Bono. Yet he’d sabotage every opportunity he got, by testing people – including those at his record label – to their limits. He was the superstar who never was.</p> <p>Milburn met Davies in 1980. “Troy lived in a great old building in St Kilda on Mitford Street and I remember walking through the sash windows and seeing him there,” she recalls. “There was a song around at the time that went “spooky little boy” and Troy just epitomised it to me. He was a strange dichotomy of creativity and menace.”</p> <p>“At that time in the post-punk scene there was a lot of lemon-sucking posing going on,” says Lowenstein. “You would adopt an English accent and pretend to be something you’re not. Troy didn’t have to prove he was cool – he knew he was. Not cool in the Nick Cave sort of way, but just himself, charming and yobbish. He burst those balloons around him and it was hilarious.”</p> <p>The film-makers have gathered a fabulous cast of witnesses from the worlds of film, art and music, Bono included, for their documentary. One thing seems evident: they all had their hearts broken by Davies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Troy dealt with life with razor-sharp wit. He carried a dark secret, yet he never acted as a victim.</p> <footer> <cite>Lynn-Maree Milburn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Probably when too much of himself existed in Vanessa, that’s when he threw her away,” observes close friend Sarah Gilbert of Davies’ tendency to switch identities. </p> <p>This dissociation could be viewed as self-preservation. The film gets darker a third of the way in, with revelations of domestic violence and incest. </p> <p>Davies’ many pasts caught up with him in 1985 when he contracted HIV, although he became one of the world’s longest-surviving Aids patients. Used to his tall stories, many friends thought he’d made up the illness, particularly when he’d turn up to clubs in his hospital gear.</p> <p>“His attitude was ‘I’m very special … AND I’m ill’,” remembers the film producer Michael Hamlyn.</p> <p>Towards the end of his life, Davies found spiritual redemption in Buddhism – and love, too. He died in 2007, aged 47, from liver failure and hepatitis C-related causes. </p> <p>“It’s an epic story of Doctor Zhivago proportions,” Lowenstein says of the documentary. “We ask some fundamental questions about what truth is – how some people are too scared to show the world who they really are, so they create these different figments.” It’s also a lesson, he says, about how we should treat artists and appreciate eccentricities.</p> <p>“None of the Davies brothers could hold a relationship down and they all had their lives ruined in some sort of way,” Lowenstein says. “Troy saw it as material. He actually said: ‘I can do something with this.’”</p> <p>• Ecco Homo will screen at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://miff.com.au/program/film/ecco-homo\">Melbourne international film

Bankhead in Her Cardboard Lover: from the archive, 14 August 1928","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-08-14T04:00:02Z","fields":{"wordcount":"571","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4bfg2","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>A new comedy and the first visit to Manchester of a much-paragraphed young actress brought a large and eager audience to the Palace last night. They had ample opportunity to gauge the curious and highly individual qualities of Miss Tallulah Bankhead, for she was seldom off the stage in the three uproarious acts of the play, and in the course of them ran up and down the whole gamut of the emotions in her distinctive manner. </p> <p>What does one carry away from an evening in her company? Her ‘cardboard lover,’ whose heart is lost at first sight of Simone, describes her personality, with the licence of the infatuate, as compact of the various charms of the Mona Lisa, Cleopatra, and Helen of Troy. We should not, in cold fact, put it quite at that. But there is an odd suggestion of Bernhardt - no less - when Miss Bankhead lets go at its full that deep voice, with its slight American intonation, that seems to operate through an inconsiderable but permanent cold in the throat; and - to jump over the stage for a second simile - there is a haunting hint of such juvenile comedians as Georgie Wood and Ivor Vintner when she lets fly a full handful of her best gaminesque tricks. </p> <p>You never quite know what she will be up to next, from a squeak of mirth to a squeal of petulance, from a burst of childlike weeping to a spell of soft-toned cajolery in which a pair of large, languorous, and full-lashed eyes get full play in a face that can be as still as a cameo on occasion. Her vigour, audacity, and flexibility within her range are tremendous. They give to the light and almost farcical fabric of this comedy a strength it would otherwise lack. For light it is. The adaptation from the French, in which Mr. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/02/new-years-honours-knighthoods-chaplin-wodehouse\">P. G. Wodehouse</a> has had a hand, keeps at a level of robust fun a theme that might well be unpleasant; but it cannot at the best make more of it than a vehicle for highly polished acting.</p> <p>Its characters move from American bar to baccarat table and bedroom de luxe, and they spend much of their time in pyjamas. The theme fits the surroundings, for Miss Bankhead plays the part of a young wife, Simone, who has secured a divorce but, fearing the fascination of her former husband, engages as an imitation lover, to fend him off, an amiable young man who worships her. The fun mounts in the frantic efforts of Simone, throughout two acts, to struggle back to Tony against the determined opposition of André, whose cardboard rapidly takes on the qualities of steel. </p> <p>In the hands of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/leslie-howard-obituary-actor\">Mr. Leslie Howard</a> this André, who is engaged as a lap dog but turns out an Airedale by breed, is an immensely amusing fellow; and the second act, in which Simone is dashed from exuberant transports of joy at the prospect of her lover’s embrace by the recurrent and surprising reappearances of her guardian at highly inconvenient moments, is a skilled and zestful bit of fooling. Mr. Jack Melford plays the husband, eloquent, egotistical, cynical, and confident, but finally outmanoeuvred with an easy sophisticated elegance that contrasts neatly with Mr. Howard’s assumption of clumsy but attractive integrity as André. It should be said that the affair is extremely well set and well clothed, pyjamas and all.</p> <p><em>A.S.W.</em></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Manchester Guardian, 14 August 1928: </strong>Bankhead’s vigour, audacity and flexibility within her range are tremendous","headline":"From the archive, 14 August 1928: Tallulah Bankhead in Her Cardboard Lover","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439464937114/6a4ffc49-fe9a-4281-bde9-79c0b1681c90-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-17T04:00:02Z","standfirst":"<p>Bankhead’s vigour, audacity and flexibility within her range are tremendous</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/the-northerner/2015/aug/14/tallulah-bankhead-her-cardboard-lover","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/the-northerner/2015/aug/14/tallulah-bankhead-her-cardboard-lover","sectionName":"Stage","tags":[{"id":"stage/theatre","webTitle":"Theatre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatre","sectionName":"Stage","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","sectionName":"Stage","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/series/from-the-archive","webTitle":"From the Guardian archive","description":"Historic articles from the Guardian archive, compiled by the Guardian research and information department (follow us on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardianlibrary\">@guardianlibrary</a>).

tells a gripping story of New York City police corruption in the grisly 1980s, when the city’s reputation for crime and disorder was at its very worst. This film has the heft of something like Scorsese’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/31/philip-french-classic-dvd-goodfellas-martin-scorsese-25th-anniversary-robert-de-niro-liotta-pesci\">Goodfellas</a> or Ferrara’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/20/bad-lieutenant-review\">Bad Lieutenant</a>, and its star witness sounds eerily like Joe Pesci in full flow. This is the crooked and not especially repentant cop Mike Dowd; Russell focuses on Dowd’s relationship with his cop partner Kenny Eurell. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/aug/13/precinct-seven-five-video-review\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4bfnn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2353856\"            data-video-name=\"Precinct Seven Five - video review\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/8/13/1439476202295/KP_386548_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-55cca9f5e4b06c6c7b93a32a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/8/13/1439476202295/KP_386548_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/08/13/150813SEVENFIVE_KP-24905032_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/08/13/150813SEVENFIVE_KP-24905032.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/08/13/150813SEVENFIVE_KP-24905032_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/08/13/150813SEVENFIVE_KP-24905032_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/08/13/150813SEVENFIVE_KP-24905032_small.3gp\"/> </video> </figure>   <p>In a culture where cops were expected to cover up for each other, Dowd and Eurell pursued an ambitious career of corruption: taking bribes from Dominican druglords, acting as their highly paid bodyguards, burgling other druglords’ apartments and co-managing the drug business with the bad guys – while naturally becoming more paranoid and crazed by ingesting the cocaine. There’s a fascinating scene in which Dowd – whose self-pitying and sentimental sense of his own cop identity never entirely leaves him – almost breaks down in tears recounting the death of another officer, shot by villains. But he never quite admits or realises his own effective complicity. It’s an absorbing study of group dysfunction.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"A fascinating documentary about two cops pursuing a cocaine-fuelled career of

Her wild lifestyle doesn’t damage her career: a calamity with an intern results in high-profile employment with another prestige magazine. Tilda Swinton plays Amy’s bullying Brit editor, and shows that she can play comedy. Trainwreck hasn’t got the acid of Apatow’s more incorrect comedies: some laughs, though.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Judd Apatow’s latest, with Amy Schumer as a

wide-open space, while rewriting an especially contentious chapter of movie history.

The narrative meanders along the way to the chastening punchline, but Eid proves a dolefully expressive lead, and Wolfgang Thaler’s ever eloquent camerawork is as fascinated by the discovery of bullet

And so it is with trepidation that we peer tentatively at the debut trailer for Dad’s Army, the second attempt to translate Jimmy Perry and David Croft’s adored 1970s show for the cinema (following the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066963/\">1971 UK box office smash</a>), in the potentially vain hope that it will enhance, rather than ruin fond memories of the original.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nig2SQk6jx4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nig2SQk6jx4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>On the positive side, Oliver Parker’s film features a cavalcade of stellar British acting talent, including Toby Jones as Captain Mainwaring, Bill Nighy as Sergeant Wilson, Michael Gambon as Private Godfrey, Tom Courtenay as Lance Corporal Jack “Don’t Panic” Jones and The Inbetweeners’ Blake Harrison as Private Pike. Catherine Zeta-Jones should provide plenty of glamour as visiting journalist Rose Winters, sent to report on the men of Walmington-on-Sea’s Home Guard platoon. On the other hand, Parker’s track record includes such desperate forays into comedy Mordor as 2007’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/21/comedy\">St Trinians</a> and 2011’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/06/johnny-english-reborn-film-review\">Johnny English Reborn</a> – and the latter’s screenwriter Hamish McColl wrote the script for the new Dad’s Army.</p> <p>The film is set at the tail end of the second world war, with Mainwaring’s ageing recruits in something of a funk until they are given the chance to patrol the Dover base of the British army proper. The trailer focuses on an abortive mission to track down a missing bull, with inevitably disastrous results, and introduces Zeta-Jones as the alluring Winters. We’re told the plot will hinge on the discovery by MI5 of a radio signal transmitted from Walmington-on-Sea towards Berlin, with top brass beginning to fear that a German spy may be operating on British soil.</p> <p>Filming on Dad’s Army began last October in Bridlington, east Yorkshire, and the film is due in cinemas on 5 February 2016. Will you be signing up?</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Don’t panic!

debut performance</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/universal-to-reimburse-security-costs-for-straight-outta-compton-screenings\">Extra security plan for US cinemas showing Straight Outta Compton</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>In the film:</strong> Cube and Dre’s first show together takes place at a cramped local club called Dooto’s. Dre’s already a regular there – DJing in a puffy, lavender jacket – and warns Cube that the crowd will be tough. But they quickly warm to the performers as Cube raps Gangsta Gangsta. Eazy and MC Ren observe the proceedings as well, a pair of Crips in a crowd of mostly Bloods.</p> <p><strong>In reality: </strong>The show actually happened at erstwhile Compton skating ring Skateland, whose kiddie pleasures were indeed belied by the overwhelming presence of Bloods. “I would tell him that with this crowd you’d better get up and rock, because if you didn’t, they’d throw these full cups at your ass,” Dre told <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rolling-in-compton-with-snoop-and-dre-20101029\">Rolling Stone</a>. Cube did perform Gangsta Gangsta, but otherwise mostly did naughty parodies of popular tracks, like turning Salt N Peppa’s I’ll Take Your Man into I’ll Fuck Your Friend. Dre’s effete costumes, meanwhile, were reserved for his first group World Class Wreckin’ Cru, who are entirely absent from the film. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6381f5ce23ff501b2e07708a0bc14bc7ccc2801\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d6381f5ce23ff501b2e07708a0bc14bc7ccc2801/68_38_2721_1634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Straight Outta Compton: not a puffy lavender jacket in sight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Straight Outta Compton: not a puffy lavender jacket in sight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaimie Trueblood/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The truth according to Ice Cube</strong><strong>: “</strong>It was a rough crowd. I was anxious to go on. I wasn’t sure what we had created was gonna work. I knew we were ready, and that we were good, but still you never know how you’re gonna be accepted by a crowd.” But it came off? “Yeah, we killed that shit. It was great. Audience was into it. They was riding on every punchline.”</p> <h2><strong>The genesis of Fuck tha Police</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9b3b4e624f17d326726eacce9082a0388d38868\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e9b3b4e624f17d326726eacce9082a0388d38868/0_161_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"How did it really go down?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How did it really go down?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaimie Trueblood/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In the film: </strong>Taking a break from recording one day at their Torrance studio, NWA steps outside, when a pair of cops – one white and one black – begin harassing them for no reason. They put the guys on the ground, until Jerry Heller intervenes, threatening to call the mayor. Soon afterward Cube writes some lyrics, Dre gives his approval, and they quickly begin recording Fuck tha Police.</p> <p><strong>In reality: </strong>In his memoir Ruthless, Jerry Heller describes a scene similar to the one outside the recording studio, called Audio Achievements. “‘On your knees, hands behind your neck,’ one officer said, approaching Yella … with a bit more energy, the other cop began barking orders at Eazy and Dre. I was befuddled. ‘What’s going on?’”. But Cube had the concept for Fuck tha Police long before Dre was on board, despite Dre’s own frustrations with law enforcement. In fact, owing to traffic infractions, in early 1988 Dre was confined to jail on weekends, allowed out only during the week, to work. </p> <p><strong>The truth according to Ice Cube</strong><strong>: </strong>“He didn’t want that song out while he had to go back and forth in the county. But when he was off of that little stint, when I brought the idea back up, he was down to do it.” What inspired you to write the song? “We were sick of being harassed by the police, just because we was young and black. [LAPD chief] Daryl Gates had declared a war on gangs. And if you think every black kid is a gang member, that means there’s a war on every black kid you see.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>If you think every black kid is a gang member, that means there’s a war on every black kid you see</p> <footer> <cite>Ice Cube</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Cube leaves NWA</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4UqMyldS7Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4UqMyldS7Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>It wasn’t a good day when Ice Cube left NWA</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>In the film: </strong>Not long after Cube sees Eazy and Heller brunching on lobster and champagne, Heller calls him into a hotel room and presents him with a contract. If he signs, he’ll also receive a $75,000 check. Cube asks to show the contract to a lawyer, but Heller insists lawyers just muck everything up. Cube then announces he’s leaving the group.</p> <p><strong>In reality: </strong>Cube thought it was ridiculous that Eazy, who owned NWA’s label Ruthless Records, and Heller, their manager, were driving luxury cars and living in mansions while he still lived with his parents. But departing NWA was not an easy decision. He secretly consulted with publicist Pat Charbonnet (who isn’t portrayed in the film), who facilitated his solo deal with Priority Records.</p> <p><strong>The truth according to Ice Cube</strong><strong>: “</strong>Pat Charbonnet was very instrumental in me recognizing that the situation with Ruthless and Jerry Heller just wasn’t right. Just by her being so smart about the business, I ended up naming her my manager, and the first person she went to was [Priority’s] Bryan Turner. She said: ‘Cube’s solo, you want to give him a deal? Or if not we’re going to go get it somewhere else.’ So he stepped up, and I’m glad he did.”</p> <h2><strong>New Music Seminar brawl</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfcd1617b6ca44f6ce06f95742d4177020a8e844\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bfcd1617b6ca44f6ce06f95742d4177020a8e844/0_41_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brawling?

Ice Cube was speaking on a panel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In the film: </strong>Cube and his new group Da Lench Mob arrive at the 1990 New Music Seminar – a New York industry showcase – where they are suddenly attacked by unidentified assailants. A bar-room style brawl commences.</p> <p><strong>In reality: </strong>Cube’s dispute was with Above the Law, a Ruthless-signed group partly tasked with filling Cube’s void when he left the label. He and their rapper/producer Cold 187um had already scrapped at an Anaheim show earlier that year, and Cube brought along Da Lench Mob partly as protection. It indeed was a wild showdown, with tables flying and shiners administered. But Cube wasn’t really involved; when it began, he was speaking on a panel. </p> <p><strong>The truth according to Ice Cube</strong><strong>: </strong>“It was thick in the air. I was more upset that we came all the way to New York – finally getting the respect we deserve – and we fucking up their seminar.” Da Lench Mob and the Zulu Nation both had your back, right? “Yeah, everybody had my back that day. Me, I wasn’t worried, I was more upset that we came out there and fucked their shit up.”</p> <h2><strong>An NWA reunion?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"395e548fbf3200fdc29bb5d4b0bf0ba9c7fb23fc\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/395e548fbf3200fdc29bb5d4b0bf0ba9c7fb23fc/0_0_5209_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Was Ice Cube ever really going to rejoin NWA?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Was Ice Cube ever really going to rejoin NWA?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Pereira/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In the film: </strong>Towards the movie’s end, Eazy asks Cube about reuniting NWA. Cube says he’s down if Jerry Heller isn’t involved, and Eazy fires the manager shortly after. Eazy then brings the reunion idea to Dre, who is 100% on board. As Eazy lays dying in hospital of Aids, Dre sobs while telling him about the amazing new tracks he’s made for the group.</p> <p><strong>In reality: </strong>Eazy and Cube did in fact speak of an NWA reunion at New York nightclub Tunnel, not long before the former learned he had Aids in 1995. But there was a major stumbling block: Dre hadn’t committed to it. In fact, Cold 187um says he wasn’t slated to produce any new NWA tracks.</p> <p><strong>The truth according to Ice Cube</strong>: “I told Eazy I was down to [reunite NWA], I thought it was a good idea. He was in his feud with Dre at the time. I told him if he could work that out, call me, and I’d be ready to go. He had told me that he had fired Jerry Heller. That’s the only reason I told him I would do it. I told him I couldn’t work with Jerry Heller.”</p> <p><em>Straight Outta Compton is released on Friday in the US and is out in the UK on Friday 28 August<br /></em></p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Did Dr Dre really DJ in a lavender puffer jacket?

He deployed it first on stage, tying himself up in knots at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRHOI2CJKDE\">his hatred</a> of schoolchum Robert Pattinson, and then parlayed it into a TV career, playing banter-fixated undergrad JP in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/nov/20/fresh-meat-second-season-better-first\">Fresh Meat</a> and an irresponsible teacher in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01djw5m\">Bad Education</a>.</p> <p>He’s now making the jump to the big screen with the latter role, as the ever-quipping Alfie Wickers takes his young charges on a school trip to Cornwall. Perhaps buoyed by the success of two Inbetweeners movies, it cleaves to dumb but satisfying gross-out comedy, involving teabagged swans, naked ziplining, and lots of Cornish stereotypes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSLFUsHAXTs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSLFUsHAXTs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Ahead of it hitting cinemas on August 21, Jack is joining us to answer your questions about it and indeed anything else.

The film starts with Reed Richards and Ben Grimm (Mr Fantastic and the Thing) as fifth graders working on a science project. The science project that (predictably) will eventually give them their powers.</p> <p>Eventually. After a while. Time stretches like Reed’s stretchy powers. It grinds like Ben’s rocky powers. It takes an hour of farting around with introducing other characters and setting up giant machines and improbable explanatory science burble before we see a single super-feat. It’s only in the last 20 minutes of the hour and 40-minute run time that you get to watch the awesome foursome exercise their CGI stunts all at the same time. The film is all portentous build up, with a little sputtering super-pay-off at the end.</p> <p>The writing isn’t terrible overall, and Miles Teller as an obliviously nerdy Reed is fine. But – who is this film aimed at? You go to a superhero movie to see superheroics, not to watch a bunch of boring science projects. If I wanted to watch McGyver or A-Team, reruns, I could have done that. It would have been cheaper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/10/fantastic-four-echo-josh-trank-hollywood\">Does Fantastic Four's plot echo Josh Trank's Hollywood journey?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The difficulty here is that when you tell a superhero story, the natural impulse is to start at the beginning – with the origin. But superhero origin stories are essentially a different genre from regular superhero stories. Superhero tales are about extraordinary superbeings bashing each other with ridiculous powers. Origin stories are about ordinary people suffering some sort of transformative trauma. The first is exhilarating, fanciful – fantastic. The other tends to be a somber downer. Watching Warthog Boy blast aliens with his tusks is one thing; watching Gomer Grunt’s family trampled by irradiated wild pigs is another. </p> <p>Jack Kirby and Stan Lee knew which sort of story they wanted to tell in their first Fantastic Four adventure in 1961. The comic opens with all the heroes summoned by a Fantastic Four flare; you get to watch each of them power up, including a famous scene where <a href=\"https://afburns.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/ben1.jpg\">The Thing bashes his way out of a sewer</a>. Then there’s a quick origin in flashback before the comic gets down to an unrelated battle against the invading subterranean Mole Man. There’s no tedious wait for the superhero powers to show up. Instead the comic gets right down to business with Kirby drawing monsters busting through things, which is what he did best. It’s what his audience was paying to see.<br /></p> <p>A brief flashback seems like a perfect way to handle superhero origins, but screen creators have been oddly reluctant to embrace it. Netflix’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/daredevil-tv-emo-superhero\">Daredevil sort of picked up on the idea</a>. The exploration of Matt Murdock’s childhood is lengthy and laborious, but at least it’s interspersed through the early part of the series as memory, so that you get to see some Daredevil action early on. More typical, though, is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/13/man-of-steel-review\">Man of Steel</a>, where you drag through Kevin Costner as foster dad Jonathan Kent providing sage advice for what feels like an age before you get to see Henry Cavill in the skintight outfit.</p> <p>What’s allowed superheroes in modern times to escape the origin trap isn’t flashbacks, but continuity. If Iron Man, Captain America and Thor all occur in the same world, then origins stop being the natural starting point for every film. You don’t need to tell how the Hulk got to be the Hulk in The Avengers, because another film already did that. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/ant-man-review-paul-rudd-marvel\">Ant-Man can just assume superheroes have been around forever</a>, which means it doesn’t exactly need to show the creation of the Ant-Man costume (just how the latest super-dude gets his hands on it). Similarly, by rebooting Batman in the context of a shared universe, the DC film Batman v Superman looks like it’s at least partially going to avoid starting out with the Bruce Wayne origin for the gazillionth time. Batman v Superman may well be dreary and dumb, but at least it looks like it will figure out a slightly less obvious way to be dreary and dumb than Man of Steel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jul/13/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-trailer-comic-con-lex-luthor\">Five things we learned from the new Batman v Superman trailer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Centering a narrative on an origin story doesn’t always have to be a bad decision. The agonized original Steve Ditko/Stan Lee Spider-Man origin was obviously intended to be sodden with guilt and misery, and it succeeded admirably. As a contrasting approach, the Deadpool trailer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/aug/05/deadpool-trailer-is-rude-crude-and-dangerously-entertaining\">looks like it treats his traumatic origin as a snide joke</a> (and one that doesn’t take up too much screen time).</p> <p>But the assumption that origins have to come first, and have to be central, seems like it frequently leads film-makers into unforced errors. If you go to a superhero film, you’re already committed to a fairly high level of suspension of disbelief. You’ve bought into the idea that superheroes exist. There’s just no need to carefully walk an audience through the preposterous pseudoscience whereby the heroes are supposed to have turned into rocks or flame or whatever. Why not forget about the backstory altogether, and give us an adventure? Who cares about the science fair project? Just show us the monster bashing out of the sewer.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The Fantastic Four reboot is the latest superhero movie that forces fans to sit through long, meandering origin stories when what they came for was the action","headline":"Pulling punches: why origin stories keep superhero films from soaring","byline":"Noah Berlatsky","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/bb6be9e0ea5e8ae53c2b130c6f8ed75bc9c34c5e/0_1721_3288_1971/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-14T11:00:01Z","standfirst":"<p>The Fantastic Four reboot is the latest superhero movie that forces fans to sit through long, meandering origin stories when what they came for was the action</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/10/superhero-movies-origin-stories-fantastic-four-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/aug/10/superhero-movies-origin-stories-fantastic-four-film","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/superhero-movies","webTitle":"Superhero movies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/superhero-movies","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/superhero-movies","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/fantastic-four","webTitle":"Fantastic Four","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-four","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/fantastic-four","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/man-of-steel-2","webTitle":"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/man-of-steel-2","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/marvel","webTitle":"Marvel","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/marvel","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/marvel","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/dc-comics","webTitle":"DC Comics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/dc-comics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/dc-comics","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/noah-berlatsky","webTitle":"Noah Berlatsky","r2ContributorId":"69616","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/8/1431113492224/Noah-Berlatsky.jpg","firstName":"noah","lastName":"berlatsky","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Noah Berlatsky is the author of Wonder Woman: Bondage and Feminism.
