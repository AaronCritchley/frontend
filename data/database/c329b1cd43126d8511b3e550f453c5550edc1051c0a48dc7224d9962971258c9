of the celebrity apartcalypse.</p> <p><strong>What? That doesn’t even make a scrap of sense.</strong> Oh, sorry. Wetzel &amp; Sons is a removal firm based in California.</p> <p><strong>OK, but what the hell is a “celebrity apartcalypse”? </strong>It’s when famous people split up. Look, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have just announced their divorce, and they hired Wetzel &amp; Sons to take their stuff away. I should have just said that instead of trying to write like a celebrity magazine. I know that now. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>You’re forgiven.</strong> Thanks. Anyway, it’s not just Affleck and Garner. Wetzel &amp; Sons’ trucks were also spotted when George Clooney split up with Stacy Kiebler, when Demi Moore split up with Ashton Kutcher and when Katy Perry split up with Russell Brand.</p> <p><strong>Wait a minute, is this just an advertising fluff piece for Wetzel &amp; Sons? </strong>No! It’s absolutely the opposite.</p> <p><strong>It is?</strong> Completely! You should never hire Wetzel &amp; Sons. As soon as people see the trucks outside your house, they’ll call the celebrity magazines and everyone will think you’re getting divorced.</p> <p><strong>That’s an exaggeration, surely. </strong>Not really. Look at this week’s Grazia. Reporters saw that Affleck and Garner had Wetzel &amp; Sons trucks outside their home, and as a result wrote that they were definitely splitting up. A few days later, the couple had officially announced their split. The trucks were a dead giveaway.</p> <p><strong>Well, that and the fact that the pair both looked genuinely miserable in every photo that’s been taken of them in the past six months. </strong>Well, sure, if you want to overanalyse things.</p> <p><strong>This can’t be good publicity for Wetzel &amp; Sons. </strong>You’re right. You’d think by now they would diversify a bit, and maybe send out unmarked trucks to these things, or trucks branded with fake company titles, such as Happytime Sunshine Removals or Definitely Not Divorcing Haulage.</p> <p><strong>Still, let’s not forget that the real victims are Bennifer. </strong>I thought we were going to get the whole way through this without using that word. I hate you.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Wetzel &amp; Sons: telegraphing marital misery since 1976.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Shall we book them to turn up at Brad Pitt’s house for a laugh?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10543557","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-07-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2330063","internalContentCode":"457328561","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"George Clooney and Stacy Kiebler used Wetzel &amp; Sons when they split.

By comparison, pop juggernauts <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/one-direction/?list=celebrities\" title=\"\">One Direction</a> played just 74 dates to earn $130m and take the number-four spot on the list.</p> <p><strong>I always thought pop stars lost money through touring. </strong>They used to, but thanks to more professional management, bigger venues and emerging global markets, it’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/17/live-music-out-performs-record-sales\" title=\"\">now extremely profitable</a>.</p> <p><strong>What does Perry think of her new status? </strong>She’s embracing it. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2015/06/29/how-katy-perry-became-americas-top-pop-export-the-forbes-cover-story/\" title=\"\">“I’m an entrepreneur,” she told Forbes</a>. “I don’t want to shy away from that.

You’re being very closed-minded. He’s a catch. A non-human, essentially incarcerated catch, but a catch nevertheless.</p> <p><strong>What is modern life, what are modern men, not providing for women that they have to start looking outside their own species for emotional and physical succour?</strong> Shabani’s former keeper Allan Schmidt reckons “most people would consider him fairly dashing”. Maybe women are just more open about their feelings.</p> <p><strong>Maybe the world’s gone insane. </strong>Maybe. But try picturing him in a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/09/colin-firth-mr-darcy-naked-pride-prejudice-bbc\"> wet shirt climbing out of a Regency lake</a>, or in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jul/17/george-clooney-nespresso-coffee-ad\">a tux and a Nespresso commercial</a>.

Established in 1583, it’s the oldest language academy in the world.</p> <p><strong>Location: </strong>Florence, of course, home of Italian culture.</p> <p><strong>Motto:</strong> “Il più bel fior ne coglie.”</p> <p><strong>Which means ...</strong> “She gathers the fairest flower.”</p> <p><strong>And what does that mean?</strong> No idea. It’s a line from Petrarch. Lost in translation, perhaps.</p> <p><strong>What’s the meaning of “Crusca”?</strong> Bran, strangely enough. They see themselves as linguistic sifters.</p> <p><strong>Does Italian need sifting?</strong> The academicians, sort of a linguistic Ukip, reckon so. They are mortified by the way English words are despoiling the beauties of Italian and are planning a fightback.</p> <p><strong>Starting when?</strong> Today.</p> <p><strong>Oggi.</strong> Well done.</p> <p><strong>Oggi, oggi, oggi. </strong>Less well done.</p> <p><strong>What’s the plan? </strong>The academy’s chief, Claudio Marazzini, has called a summit and is promising to set up a quick-response unit to “go after politicians, bureaucrats and journalists who bring English words into our language”.</p> <p><strong>What sort of words are worrying them? </strong>The communications expert Annamaria Testa, <a href=\"http://nuovoeutile.it/dire_in_italiano/\" title=\"\">who started the campaign last year</a>, enumerated hundreds, including austerity, chewing gum, download, outsourcing, public relations, politically correct, taskforce, welfare and wishful thinking. Management jargon was especially singled out. The Italian navy then made matters worse by using the slogan <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-31453590\" title=\"\">“Be cool and join the navy”</a>. The last straw was prime minister Matteo Renzi tabling a “jobs act”.</p> <p><strong>Instead of?</strong> La legge sul lavoro.</p> <p><strong>Ah, naturalmente.</strong> Yep. Anyway, a petition to ban “Italianglo” has attracted <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11464718/Inheritors-of-Dante-launch-Say-it-in-Italian-campaign-against-language-of-Dickens.html\" title=\"\">70,000 signatories</a>.</p> <p><strong>And quite a few signoras, too, presumably? </strong>Indeed. The academicians want to dispatch Italians who use hybrid versions of English words to a particularly fiery circle of hell.</p> <p><strong>Such as?</strong> “Footing” for jogging, “baby parking” for creche, “sexy shop” for sex shop, “mister” for football manager, “box” for garage.</p> <p><strong>Can the academicians win? </strong>“It’s too late to do something about ‘car sharing’,” <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4476580.ece\" title=\"\">admits Marazzini</a>, “but we need to find Italian words in a hurry for ‘quantitative easing’.”</p> <p><strong>Alleggerimento quantitativo?</strong> OK, we can all use Google Translate.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with:</strong> The war on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/13/the-battle-to-keep-french-pure-is-doomed\" title=\"\">Franglais</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do mention:</strong> Dante, Ariosto, Boccaccio, Calvino, Machiavelli, Pirandello, Umberto Eco.</p> <p><strong>Don’t mention: </strong>Going forward.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10515751","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-06-23T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2324740","internalContentCode":"457239653","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Are you Italian?

</figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> Donald Trump.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Man – 69. Hair – tests inconclusive on material unknown to science.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>69-year-old man wearing dead alien animal on his head.</p> <p><strong>Has he died? </strong>Only from the hairline up. The rest of him is too rich to die.</p> <p><strong>What has he done then?</strong> Announced that he is running for US president.</p> <p><strong>Doesn’t he do this every year? Regardless of whether or not there’s a presidential race? </strong>Yes, but this time it’s official. On a stage in the basement of Trump Tower in Manhattan, surrounded by eight American flags, to the soundtrack of Neil Young’s Rockin’ in the Free World, Donald Trump told the world that he is running for president. And Young told the world that Trump did not have permission to use his music.</p> <p><strong>OK, so what’s Trump promising?</strong> To get rid of Obamacare.</p> <p><strong>That’s a given. What else?</strong> To take back America, which Obama has reduced to the level of a third-world country and handed over to the Chinese, whose leaders hopelessly outclass Uncle Sam’s. It’s like “the New England Patriots and Tom Brady [versus] a high-school team,” says Donald.</p> <p><strong>Ah, Trump truth. Splendid. </strong>And he’s going to stop Mexico “sending us all the wrong people”.</p> <p><strong>Let me guess. Does it involve a wall?</strong> Yes! Are you psychic? It involves “a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall”.</p> <p><strong>Anything else?</strong> He’s going to cut spending on education, massively. “People are tired of spending more money on education per capita than any other country.”</p> <p><strong>Yes, that is a national disgrace. </strong>And he’s going to be “the greatest jobs president that God ever made” and reduce the real goddamn unemployment rate from 20%.</p> <p><strong>I thought the US unemployment rate was 5.4%?</strong> That’s just the official government figure. Trump believes it to be 18-20%, so that is what he is going to reduce it from.</p> <p><strong>I see. Anything else before I go and drive myself off a cliff?</strong> He has disclosed, in accordance with legislation, that he is worth $8.73bn and will be using his own money to try to buy the presidency.</p> <p><strong>You mean, run his campaign?</strong> Tomato, tomahto.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Stephen Colbert – your country needs you.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“No it doesn’t – satire is dead.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10499863","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-06-18T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2321983","internalContentCode":"457188754","publication":"The

<p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Discreet.</p> <p><strong>Status: </strong>Power behind the throne.</p> <p><strong>OK, but what does Fgotus stand for? </strong>First grandmother of the United States, a variant of Potus (president of the United States) and Flotus (first lady of the United States).</p> <p><strong>Any other presidential acronyms we should know about? </strong>Bo, the Obamas’ dog, is Fpotus.</p> <p><strong>First Pet? </strong>Indeed.</p> <p><strong>Does the Fgotus have a name? </strong>She does: Marian Robinson. She lives with the Obamas in the White House and is in the UK on a trip with daughter Michelle and the Fdotus.</p> <p><strong>Fdotus? </strong>The first daughters of the United States, Malia and Sasha. Do try to keep up.</p> <p><strong>Where’s the Potus? </strong>I don’t know, probably playing golf somewhere.</p> <p><strong>And the first pet? </strong>In the first kennel.</p> <p><strong>Why is Michelle here? </strong>Promoting girls’ education, meeting Prince Harry, the usual Flotus stuff.</p> <p><strong>Is Prince Harry interested in girls’ education?</strong> He thinks of little else.</p> <p><strong>Well, here’s to you, Mrs Robinson.</strong> Thanks for getting that in. It’s very much her daughter’s view. She calls Fgotus her “rock”.</p> <p><strong>What does the Potus call her? </strong>Not sure, but he did once joke about her fondness for going to Las Vegas.</p> <p><strong>How does Mrs R see her role? </strong>“My job is the easiest one of all,” she said in 2012. “I just get to be grandma.”</p> <p><strong>Making jam, baking cakes, knitting sweaters? </strong>Don’t be grandma-ist. She dispenses advice to the Obamas and keeps a matronly eye on the Fdotus, who have had to grow up in the full glare of the media spotlight.</p> <p><strong>What else do we know about her? </strong>Marian and her boilerman husband Fraser lived in a far from affluent part of Chicago, but got both their children to Princeton. She was a housewife when her children were young, but worked in a bank later and took up competitive running in her 50s. Fraser died in 1991.</p> <p><strong>Does she like living in the White House?</strong> She didn’t at first. “The White House reminds me of a museum,” she complained, “and how do you sleep in a museum?”</p> <p><strong>Also known as: </strong>The grandmother-in-chief.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to say: </strong>“Barack!!!!!”</p> <p><strong>Least likely to say:</strong> “We are a grandmother.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10497523","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-06-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2321422","internalContentCode":"457180254","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Want to avoid making a fool of yourself in front of your Secret Service pals?

Jeb Bush is launching his bid for the US presidency on Monday, and has kind of prelaunched it by posting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/610063493237084160\">this 2016 graphic on Twitter</a>, along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vet1HHyYtZQ\">a video</a> that doesn’t quite say that he’s running for president but, you know, implies it.</p> <p><strong>Jeb! It sounds like a sitcom or a Broadway musical.</strong> It could also be someone swearing.</p> <p><strong>Perhaps soon it will be. But why say it is 21 years old if he has only just launched it?</strong> Because he has been campaigning with a big red Jeb! since 1994.</p> <p><strong>Short for Jebediah?</strong> Actually, it’s an acronym from John Ellis Bush.</p> <p><strong>And, politically speaking, how many yee-haws out of 10 does John Ellis score on the Bush scale? </strong>About six. To liberals, he looks like another cowboy theocrat; to the Tea Party, he’s a Latino-hugging wuss. According to his video, he “takes conservative principles and applies them so that people can rise up”.</p> <p><strong>In other words, he might actually win?</strong> Maybe. He’s certainly the favourite for the Republican nomination.</p> <p><strong>To go up against Hillary!?</strong> Probably. Although she’s just <a href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/14/us/politics/14firstdraft-hillary-logo/14firstdraft-hillary-logo-tmagArticle-v3.png\">an H with an arrow</a>, in fact.</p> <p><strong>Why do politicians do this?</strong> Because expensive consultants tell them, and they are desperate to be liked. Even Yvette Cooper has <a href=\"http://www.yvettecooper.com\">her own Yvette logo</a> for the Labour leadership.</p> <p><strong>Why not Yvette! with an exclamation mark?</strong> We’re British, remember. Plus it might make people sing “the best a man can get!” afterwards.</p> <p><strong>You don’t want that.</strong> You definitely do not.</p> <p><strong>So it’s Clinton v Bush again in 2016?</strong> Could be. Even if neither of them uses the surname.</p> <p><strong>Isn’t that a bit odd?</strong> Actually, it’s very, very normal. Five of the last seven US presidential elections had a Clinton or a Bush in the running, and the Clinton or Bush won every time.</p> <p><strong>But isn’t democracy supposed to stop people just inheriting power?</strong> Sometimes it’s just easier to relate to political dynasties. A bit like in India, or the middle ages.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Stephen Kinnock!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Dubya!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10493451","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-06-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2320513","internalContentCode":"457163450","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The latest Bush to run for the US presidency is shouting it out loud with his new logo","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Jeb!

</strong></p> <p><strong>Age: </strong>One week old, but 200 years in the making.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Possibly the funniest thing that Belgium has ever done.</p> <p><strong>Is Belgium a particularly funny country?</strong> Oh, the funniest. The closest thing it has to a national emblem is a statue of a little boy having a wee. Belgium is the greatest.</p> <p><strong>And this coin is somehow funnier than a weeing boy? What’s on it, a pooing monkey?</strong> Better than that: a lion on a plinth.</p> <p><strong>Ha ha… ha?</strong> It’s to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, stupid.</p> <p><strong>I’m still not entirely sure where the humour lies in this.</strong> So, three months ago, Belgium proposed the introduction of a commemorative Waterloo €2 coin. But, because it represented the country’s most humiliating military defeat, France vetoed it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/10/greece-creditors-reforms-tsipras-merkel-hollande-live\">Pressure intensifies on Greece to make more concessions - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>But this isn’t about a €2 coin.</strong> Exactly. Instead of giving up, Belgium went away and found an obscure law stating that any country in the eurozone could issue any new coins it wanted, providing they’re in an irregular denomination. So it invented a €2.5 coin, and minted 70,000 of those to commemorate Waterloo instead.</p> <p><strong>So all this is just a hopelessly convoluted way for Belgium to stick it to France?</strong> Exactly. It’s like Scotland printing up a £7.50 note plastered with the crying faces of all its ousted Labour MPs.</p> <p><strong>That is actually kind of brilliant, isn’t it?</strong> All of Belgium is great. It went 18 months without a government once, plus it invented roller skates, pralines and saxophones. Belgium is the country all other countries aspire to be.</p> <p><strong>How has France taken this? </strong>To be fair, incredibly sanguinely. However, this year is also the 500th anniversary of the French victory at Marignano, and Italy recently was among the nations which similarly vetoed plans for a commemorative €2 coin.</p> <p><strong>Are you suggesting that France will copy Belgium and make a €2.50 coin specifically to annoy Italy?</strong> It’s not definite but, by God, I hope so.</p> <p><strong>This is fun, eh?</strong> It is. And it will be, right up until someone makes a €2.50 Bayeux tapestry coin.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I knew money would tear Europe apart, but not like this.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Still, at least that’s Europe’s biggest problem solved.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10478054","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-06-11T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2317926","internalContentCode":"457118971","publication":"The
