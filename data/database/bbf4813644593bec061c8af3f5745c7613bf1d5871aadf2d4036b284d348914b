</strong>That would be telling.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Discreet, subtle but, you know, up for it.</p> <p><strong>Is this a male Ashley or a female Ashley?</strong> Neither. It’s a corporate Ashley. Ashley Madison is the name of a website founded in Toronto in 2001, which sells married people the opportunity to connect with each other and have affairs.</p> <p><strong>Ah, yes. I’ve heard of that. But why can’t married people just have sex with their workmates as usual? </strong>Oh you know, it can get complicated. Plus not everybody has workmates they want sex with.</p> <p><strong>Nonsense! I’d gladly have sex with you. </strong>Thanks. Anyway, Ashley Madison is in trouble because its ultra-sensitive customer data <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/20/ashley-madison-hacked-cheating-site-total-shutdown\">has just been breached by a hacker or hackers unknown</a>.</p> <p><strong>Would you have sex with me? </strong>The hackers call themselves the Impact Team, and claim to have accessed the entire database of Ashley Madison’s 37m users and the 1.3m users of Established Men (matching older men with younger women). They have already released some credit card details and company documents, and are threatening to publish everything else unless the parent company Avid Life Media shuts both sites down.</p> <p><strong>Are these family-values hackers then? </strong>No. They say they are responding to the fact that Ashley Madison charges departing users $19 to conduct a “full delete” of their data. (Although they <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/cheaters-hook-up-site-ashley-madison-makes-account-deletion-confusing/\">can leave and become nearly untraceable for free</a>.)</p> <p><strong>So they are online privacy campaigners, but they are trying to get their way with a massive breach of online privacy? </strong>That’s right. If their demands are not met, they promise to release “all the customers’ secret sexual fantasies, nude pictures, and conversations and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses”.</p> <p><strong>A bit hypocritical maybe? </strong>Or maybe a bit personal. Avid Life Media says it suspects an inside job. “We’re on the doorstep of [confirming] who we believe is the culprit, and unfortunately that may have triggered this mass publication,” says the site’s founder Noel Biderman. “I’ve got their profile right in front of me, all their work credentials. It was definitely a person here that was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.”</p> <p><strong>Do you at least think I’m attractive? </strong>This comes just four months after a <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/22/technology/adult-friendfinder-hacked/\">hack on Adult FriendFinder</a>, which revealed the unusual sexual preferences of 3.5m people.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Life is short. Have an affair.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“But also unpredictable. Get a lawyer.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10603418","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-07-21T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2340480","internalContentCode":"457542363","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The website for extra-marital relationships has been hacked after charging users for a ‘full delete’ of their data.

troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Sinister enough to upset the status quo of government.</p> <p><strong>Is this a Scottish thing? </strong>No, it’s a British thing. British citizens are suddenly being overrun by McPeople.</p> <p><strong>Are we? I can’t say I’d noticed. </strong>Well, technically, by “British citizens” – I mean, “British MPs”, but, to my mind, they’re one and the same.</p> <p><strong>This is about the SNP, isn’t it? </strong>Not entirely. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/02/conservative-mp-philip-hollobone-too-many-mcs-commons\" title=\"\">a good number of their MPs have got surnames that begin with ‘“Mc”</a>.</p> <p><strong>Right. Because they’re Scottish. </strong>Scottish, Irish, Nepalese, I don’t care where they come from. All I know is that they’ve buggered up the House of Commons voting system something chronic.</p> <p><strong>Have they? </strong>Yes! We’ve now got 25 MPs whose surnames begin with either Mc or Mac. This means that if you’re an MP with a surname that begins with G-M, your voting queue has now grown unconscionably long.</p> <p><strong>Really? This whole fuss is because a few MPs don’t like to queue? </strong>Yes, but don’t worry. We’ve fixed it now. From September, all politicians with <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/SNP/11743621/SNPs-many-Mcs-prompt-change-to-Commons-voting-system.html\" title=\"\">G surnames will be moved over to the A-F desk</a> to even things out a bit.</p> <p><strong>So what you’re saying is that now all the A-F politicians will have to deal with unmanageably long queues instead?</strong> Well, currently, yes. But hopefully we can offset the influx by moving the nine MPs called either Davis or Davies down to the N-S desk.</p> <p><strong>Really? But that’s where all the Smiths are. </strong>Oh, actually, you’re right. We’ve got 12 Smiths, Smyths or Smeeths, so adding the Davises and Davieses would make that too long as well. Let’s bump the Smiths down a desk.</p> <p><strong>You know there are 13 MPs called either Johnson or Jones too, right?</strong> Well that won’t do. Let’s put them down where the Davises are, move  the Davises back up to H-M, put all Macs down to T-Z and keep the Mcs where they are. There. Simple.</p> <p><strong>I’m so pleased you’re in charge of the country. </strong>Me, too!</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“This wouldn’t have happened if Scotland had voted for independence.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Actually, 18 Mc/Macs aren’t even Scottish MPs.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10595921","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-07-20T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2339399","internalContentCode":"457527198","publication":"The

Not another icon fallen. I can’t bear it. To see Mary Poppins reduced to this by the demon drink … That I should have lived so long. </strong>Relax, it’s not that bad.</p> <p><strong>Oh, really? How do you face the death of childhood with such equanimity, pray tell? </strong>Because it’s just a description used in a University of Missouri-Columbia survey into drunkenness. “Mary Poppinses” are the nice drunks, who remain friendly and cooperative before they fall unconscious.</p> <p><strong>What are the others? Pas from Little House on the Prairie, who remain manly and unaffected? Colins from The Secret Garden, who turn nasty under the influence (he would, you know)? Wizards of Oz, who turn into something quite different once the veil of sobriety is ripped from them? </strong>Right categories, wrong characters.</p> <p><strong>Go on, then. </strong>About 42% of the inebriated population are “Hemingways”, who can, as the man himself claimed, “drink hells any amount of whiskey without getting drunk”.</p> <p><strong>The rallying cry for functioning alcoholics everywhere. How do the remaining 58% divide? </strong>Well,<strong> </strong>20% are “Nutty Professors”, introverts who become extroverts; 23% are “Mr Hydes”, who become vile; and 15% are Edwardian nannies.</p> <p><strong>Mary Poppins is actually quite a cow in the books, but we’ll leave that aside for the moment, given the more pressing issue. </strong>Which is?</p> <p><strong>That this is clearly utter rubbish. </strong>How so?</p> <p><strong>Forty years of living and drinking in Britain – that’s more than 4,000 nights out on the lash – has empirically demonstrated to me that the breakdown is more like 95% Nutty Professors, 2% Hemingways, 2% Mary Poppinses and 1% Mr Hydes successfully ruining everything for everyone. </strong>I agree that your statistical analysis accords better with local experience, but maybe things are different in America.</p> <p><strong>Also, you need to pick a nomenclatural theme once you publish your research. ALL children’s book figures, or ALL classic gothic fiction or ALL canonical US titans. Otherwise, how are we meant to take it seriously? </strong>A good point. Let’s have a drink and talk it over.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “It’s liver damage whatever you call yourself, you know?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “A spoonful of sugar makes this caipirinha go down lovely!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10588558","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-07-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2337928","internalContentCode":"457504089","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"An American survey has divided drinkers into four cultural character types – Hemingways, Nutty Professors, Mr Hydes and Mary Poppinses – according to how they behave when they are under the influence","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Super pally?

<p><strong>Age:</strong> Already too old for this joke of a world.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Hard to say, since your vision will involuntarily blur and darken upon sight of her.</p> <p><strong>That bad? It sounds as if you’re just talking about a cash machine. </strong>You don’t understand. It’s a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/gallery/2007/jun/27/1\" title=\"\">cash machine</a> called Sally (or sometimes Mike or Jake). <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3158660/Patronising-Barclays-Bank-accused-insulting-customers-naming-ATMs-Sally-Mike-Jake.html\" title=\"\">The things have names</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why does it have a name? </strong>It’s part of a new Barclays initiative in a handful of branches to get customers used to its <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/experts/article-2611365/Why-Barclays-removed-counters-replaced-machines.html\" title=\"\">assisted service counters</a>, which are basically gussied-up ATMs.</p> <p><strong>And why don’t they just call the machines assisted service counters? </strong>Because that makes them sound chilling and totalitarian, like their onscreen options would include “Receive lethal injection” and “Obey your faceless masters”.</p> <p><strong>So, what exactly is the problem with calling them “Sally”?</strong> Because it’s so twee. It doesn’t credit customers with any intelligence. It’s less a cash machine and more a cross between an Innocent smoothie bottle and the Terminator.</p> <p><strong>What’s wrong with Innocent smoothie bottles?</strong> Have you read the back of one? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/mar/25/wackaging-trend-food-packaging-innocent-language\" title=\"\">It’s like someone has dictated the ambient thoughts of the world’s most insufferable three-year-old</a>.</p> <p><strong>Are we getting off-subject here? </strong>No, it’s all part of the same problem. These gigantic, terrifying corporations are trying to endear themselves to us by making themselves as infuriatingly cutesy and infantile as possible. It started with smoothies; now, it’s bank machines. Next thing you know, GlaxoSmithKline will be renaming itself Mr Glitterchop’s Yummy-Wummy Medicine Company.</p> <p><strong>I think you might be overreacting. </strong>I’m not. Barclays is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/28/rage-against-machines-people-staffing-banks-cashiers\" title=\"\">getting rid of flesh-and-blood bank workers</a> and giving folksy names to their robot replacements in the hope that we won’t be able to tell the difference.</p> <p><strong>If you hate it so much, why don’t you stop banking with Barclays? </strong>Oh, because it’s too complicated. All my Etsy money is paid into a Barclays account.</p> <p><strong>You have an Etsy page? </strong>Yes. I make artisan, heart-shaped bunting that spells out the phrase: “I Wuv Ooh, Snuggle-Bear.”</p> <p><strong>Really? </strong>Look, it’s different. It is.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“This is a cash machine. Its name is ‘Cash Machine’.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Press one to display your balance, two for a withdrawal or three for a big cuddle.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10581324","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-07-14T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2336350","internalContentCode":"457479280","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Barclays is slowly replacing cashiers in its branches with ‘assisted service counters’.

</strong>Under 23.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Perennially slumped of shoulders and miserable, and usually picking a football out of the back of the net.</p> <p><strong>Status:</strong> Whipping boys of the Pacific Games.</p> <p><strong>Pacific Games, eh? Sounds prestigious. </strong>Yes, but not especially enjoyable if you happen to be a fan of Micronesia. They’ve just finished bottom of their group.</p> <p><strong>Were they eliminated due to a last-minute own-goal howler, much like England’s proud footballing Lionesses? </strong>Not quite. They started with a 30-0 against Tahiti, followed that up with a hard-fought 38-0 defeat against Fiji, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/07/micronesia-defeat-46-vanuatu-pacific-games\">lost 46-0 to Vanuatu</a>.</p> <p><strong>Who is to blame for this debacle? At whose managerial desk does the buck stop?</strong> Their Australian coach is Stan Foster.</p> <p><strong>I have not heard of this man.</strong> He’s a recent addition to the managerial set-up. Interestingly, one of his managerial predecessors was none other than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paul_c_watson\">Paul Watson</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ah yes. And who might he be? </strong>Well, for one thing, he is the brother of stand-up comedian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-watson\">Mark Watson</a>. But he also turned his experiences of managing Micronesia in 2009 and 2010 into a book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Up-Pohnpei-ultimate-football-underdogs/dp/1846685028\">Up Pohnpei</a>, which in turn looks set to be made into a film.</p> <p><strong>And can he shed any light on the team’s current trough in form? </strong>Lack of funding. He compares <a href=\"http://sport360.com/article/football/39181/when-46-0-isn%E2%80%99t-bad-result-why-micronesia-must-be-allowed-join-fifa\">sending a team like Micronesia</a> out against the giants of Fiji as being like sending a Sunday league team out to play <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool</a>.</p> <p><strong>If they’re so terrible at football, why do they do it? </strong>It’s a matter of principle and pride and the possibility of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa\">Fifa</a> funding. If Micronesia keep putting a team out in tournaments, even if they keep getting hammered like this, they will qualify for Fifa development funding and may - wonder of wonders - actually receive it some day.</p> <p><strong>Presumably they’ll receive it in a plain brown envelope or in the form of expensive watches. </strong>Yes, that’s very biting and current, well done.</p> <p><strong>Is there any hope for Micronesia? Could they ever be the footballing mouse that roared?</strong> Absolutely. To give you some idea of what these tiny teams can do, only a few weeks ago the island of Guam, whose population of about 160,000 is not that much larger than that of Micronesia, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/16/guam-beat-india-world-cup-qualifier\">beat India (population: 1.252 billion) 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Fiji’s 33rd was clearly offside and we spotted a push on the keeper for their 39th.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Can we play you/ Can we play you/ Can we play you every week?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10566746","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-07-09T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2333983","internalContentCode":"457441417","publication":"The

of the celebrity apartcalypse.</p> <p><strong>What? That doesn’t even make a scrap of sense.</strong> Oh, sorry. Wetzel &amp; Sons is a removal firm based in California.</p> <p><strong>OK, but what the hell is a “celebrity apartcalypse”? </strong>It’s when famous people split up. Look, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have just announced their divorce, and they hired Wetzel &amp; Sons to take their stuff away. I should have just said that instead of trying to write like a celebrity magazine. I know that now. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>You’re forgiven.</strong> Thanks. Anyway, it’s not just Affleck and Garner. Wetzel &amp; Sons’ trucks were also spotted when George Clooney split up with Stacy Kiebler, when Demi Moore split up with Ashton Kutcher and when Katy Perry split up with Russell Brand.</p> <p><strong>Wait a minute, is this just an advertising fluff piece for Wetzel &amp; Sons? </strong>No! It’s absolutely the opposite.</p> <p><strong>It is?</strong> Completely! You should never hire Wetzel &amp; Sons. As soon as people see the trucks outside your house, they’ll call the celebrity magazines and everyone will think you’re getting divorced.</p> <p><strong>That’s an exaggeration, surely. </strong>Not really. Look at this week’s Grazia. Reporters saw that Affleck and Garner had Wetzel &amp; Sons trucks outside their home, and as a result wrote that they were definitely splitting up. A few days later, the couple had officially announced their split. The trucks were a dead giveaway.</p> <p><strong>Well, that and the fact that the pair both looked genuinely miserable in every photo that’s been taken of them in the past six months. </strong>Well, sure, if you want to overanalyse things.</p> <p><strong>This can’t be good publicity for Wetzel &amp; Sons. </strong>You’re right. You’d think by now they would diversify a bit, and maybe send out unmarked trucks to these things, or trucks branded with fake company titles, such as Happytime Sunshine Removals or Definitely Not Divorcing Haulage.</p> <p><strong>Still, let’s not forget that the real victims are Bennifer. </strong>I thought we were going to get the whole way through this without using that word. I hate you.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Wetzel &amp; Sons: telegraphing marital misery since 1976.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Shall we book them to turn up at Brad Pitt’s house for a laugh?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10543557","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-07-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2330063","internalContentCode":"457328561","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"George Clooney and Stacy Kiebler used Wetzel &amp; Sons when they split.

What?</strong> He’s the internet’s latest heart-throb.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, let’s just look him up … Hang on, I must have spelled his name wrong.</strong> Are you looking at pictures of a gorilla?</p> <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Handsome, isn’t he?</p> <p><strong>As gorillas go, I suppose he’s… Wait. This resident of </strong><a href=\"http://www.higashiyama.city.nagoya.jp/14_english/\"><strong>Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens</strong></a><strong> is the heart-throb?</strong> Young Japanese women <a href=\"http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/06/25/zoo-reports-increase-in-visitors-as-japans-women-fall-for-this-handsome-gorilla%E3%80%90photos%E3%80%91/\">discovered him recently</a> and have big love for the Western Lowland silverback they customarily hashtag #Ikemen or #ikumen.</p> <p><strong>Meaning?</strong> “Hot young guy” and “hands-on dad”.</p> <p><strong>Did I miss a memo?

He’s a loving father of two, whom he had with an older woman.</p> <p><strong>Can I just check – you do mean female gorilla, don’t you? </strong>Yes.</p> <p><strong>OK, continue.</strong> He’s got brooding good looks, a fantastic body – you can watch him flex those pecs in photos and videos on <a href=\"https://instagram.com/explore/tags/shabani/\">Instagram</a> any time you fancy – and a highly intelligent, thoughtful mien. His keepers say he comes from very stable parents. And if hairy men are your thing – ker-ching!</p> <p><strong>Yes, but – he is still … how can I put this … he is still A GORILLA. </strong>As female Twitterer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LJRHW/status/614108398146207744\">@ljrhw put it:</a> “He kinda does it for me.”</p> <p><strong>This is terrifying. </strong>Nonsense. You’re being very closed-minded. He’s a catch. A non-human, essentially incarcerated catch, but a catch nevertheless.</p> <p><strong>What is modern life, what are modern men, not providing for women that they have to start looking outside their own species for emotional and physical succour?</strong> Shabani’s former keeper Allan Schmidt reckons “most people would consider him fairly dashing”. Maybe women are just more open about their feelings.</p> <p><strong>Maybe the world’s gone insane. </strong>Maybe. But try picturing him in a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/09/colin-firth-mr-darcy-naked-pride-prejudice-bbc\"> wet shirt climbing out of a Regency lake</a>, or in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jul/17/george-clooney-nespresso-coffee-ad\">a tux and a Nespresso commercial</a>.
