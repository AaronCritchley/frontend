Lenkiewicz: this government is 'determined to crush the poor'","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T08:43:38Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>At first glimpse there isn’t much of a connection between a play set in the 1700s about a woman who has been hanged as a witch and one about legal aid cuts in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. But playwright <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jan/20/rebecca-lenkiewicz-playwright\">Rebecca Lenkiewicz</a> is certain that there is – and not just because her name is on the front page of both plays. <a href=\"http://www.outofjoint.co.uk/production/jane-wenham-the-witch-of-walkern\">Jane Wenham: The Witch of Walkern</a> (opening later this year at Watford Palace and then on tour) and <a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/the-invisible/\">The Invisible</a> (now at the Bush theatre in west London) are set worlds and centuries apart, but both explore communities under pressure and the age-old tendency to start witch-hunting. Lenkiewicz is confident now is one of those times.</p> <p>“I’m deeply troubled about the way society increasingly talks about the poor and less fortunate. There’s such a shift from when I was young,” says Lenkiewicz who is now in her mid-40s. “The language used is so scary, the talk of those on benefits as being ‘manipulative’ or human beings described as ‘cockroaches’. The fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/30/katie-hopkins-life-harder-disabled-people\">Katie Hopkins</a> has a page in the Sun. That kind of language is spreading and fast. It’s terrifying.”</p> <p>Language is Lenkiewicz’s currency. An actor turned playwright, she has a remarkable facility for words in performance, possibly because she knows about the pleasure of speaking lines that are textured, full of possibilities and don’t always give up their meanings too easily. She loves actors, saying they are the ones who “are on the front line”, and admiring the way they can bring “insight and clarity” to what she has written. “Sometimes you know that what you’ve written is a bit pedestrian and it becomes something completely other because of their interpretation.” She still misses acting. “I would do it again if I could, but I’ve lost the muscle. I’d want to be brilliant at it and I’d fall short.”<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jan/20/rebecca-lenkiewicz-playwright\">Playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz: 'I had evil thoughts as a child'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Falling short is not something Lenkiewicz has much experience of as a writer. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/10/nicholas-hytner-national-theatre-director-12-years-verdict\">Nicholas Hytner</a> is a fan, talking of her “tremendous gift for dialogue”. Hytner programmed two of her plays while he was running the National Theatre – including her second play, the Chekhovian Irish family drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/aug/04/theatre1\">The Night Season</a>, and the suffragette epic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/02/theatre1\">Her Naked Skin</a>, the first original play by a living female writer to be staged in the Olivier. </p> <p>On stage, her dialogue dances. Face to face, she’s quite reticent, perhaps as result of being too unguarded about her personal life to journalists in the past, and the fact that her first play, in 2000, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/07/artsfeatures.edinburghfestival20002\">Soho: A Tale of Table Dancers</a>, grabbed the headlines for all the wrong reasons because it was inspired by her own – very brief – experience of table dancing. But she can also be unexpectedly and disarmingly open, too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL5nE_j5GsU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KL5nE_j5GsU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>“I feel very raw,” she suddenly says at one point during the conversation when we are talking about The Invisible and Jane Wenham and their emphasis on “the other” and those who fall outside society’s boundaries of conformity. “Maybe it’s because I’m at the halfway point in my life, when you are thinking about the ground you’ve made and the ground you haven’t, but I feel very sensitised to what’s happening and this fear of otherness and push towards conformity. Feeling raw is not a pleasant feeling, but it can be a fruitful feeling.”</p> <p>For a writer, certainly. She draws on that rawness in both plays. In Jane Wenham, developed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/27/max-stafford-clark-interview-out-of-joint-arts-funding-british-theatre\">Max Stafford-Clark</a> for Out of Joint, she writes about women in all their complexity, beauty and unflinching cruelty, focusing on women who are viewed as outsiders, and particularly “men’s terror” of such women. As the title suggests, The Invisible is about those whom we prefer to leave hidden from view and whose safety nets are being steadily dismantled by the current government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/07/artsfeatures.edinburghfestival20002\">Arts: Rebecca Lenkiewicz interviewed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Invisible is a Bush commission, and when Lenkiewicz went in to have an initial meeting with <a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/about-us/the-team/\">artistic director Madani Younis</a> she was confident that she would turn it down because she had so many other projects bubbling under. But when she heard the extent of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/sep/25/-sp-legal-aid-forgotten-pillar-welfare-state-special-report-impact-cuts\">cuts to legal aid – in 2013-14 43,000 fewer people</a> in England and Wales were granted legal aid to be represented in court – she instantly said yes, feeling she had to do something, and speak up about a situation where, increasingly, those on lower incomes are being denied access to legal advice.</p> <p>Law firms such as the one in The Invisible, which take on legal-aid cases, are closing because they simply cannot make enough money to pay overheads and salaries. Even criminal justice is affected: last month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jun/25/lawyers-to-refuse-criminal-cases-in-protest-at-cuts-to-legal-aid-fees\">solicitors and barristers threatened strike action in Liverpool</a> after incurring a further reduction of 8.75% in legal-aid fees in the wake of a 17.5% cut last year.</p> <p> “People are being punished for being poor,” Lenkiewicz says indignantly. The Invisible tells the human stories behind the statistics rather than dealing in the statistics themselves. “Every time I put in a statistic, it felt like a clunk. So now audiences are going to be given leaflets after the play that have all the facts and figures.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS72tYfGn0Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MS72tYfGn0Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>She’s aware that writing a play is not necessarily going to change the government’s mind and that it is “a cry in the wilderness”, but she refuses to stand by and be silent about “a government that is determined to crush the poor and vulnerable. All I can do is shout loudly about it. A play may be a very small ripple, but it’s a start.”</p> <p>In February this year Lenkiewicz was at the Oscars where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ida-pawel-pawlikowski-nun-road-movie\">Ida</a>, the film she co-wrote with Paweł Pawlikowski about a novice nun in 1960s Poland, won the award for best foreign language film. She is currently working on another film script, about the second world war <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/oct/23/noor-inayat-khan-britains-muslim-heroine\">allied spy Noor Inayat Khan</a>, who worked as a radio operator in Nazi-occupied Paris and was arrested and sent to Dachau, where she was executed, apparently with the word “Liberté” on her lips. “That’s what we all want: freedom. The freedom to be ourselves, that’s my mantra,” says Lenkiewicz quietly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b32f23e1e24c97d95701757c96888f3084878a6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436195762660/139e88bd-7536-4f91-8794-129e75d2d46f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ida, film still\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agata Kulesza in Ida, which Rebecca Lenkiewicz co-wrote with Paweł Pawlikowski.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being in Los Angeles was a thrill because she has always been movie-mad – she remembers seeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/13/les-enfants-du-paradis-review\">Les Enfants du Paradis</a> at the Electric Cinema in Portobello Road, London, as a seven-year-old with her father. But she recognises that something like the Oscars is “only a punctuation, a lovely moment of euphoria” in a life dedicated to the writing.</p> <p>“I love writing. For me, the real joy is the writing process itself. Everything that comes after is an adventure and it can be joyful and sometimes painful, but it’s set apart from the work. What I love is finding the idea, and then that moment when the piece starts to speak to you. That’s the fertile time. The dirt of the work is where I’m at my most confident.

forced to apologise after tweeting a picture of a child suffering from autism and tuberous sclerosis without his family’s permission.</p> <p>Carrey tweeted the picture of Karen Echols’ son Alex as part of a protest against <a href=\"http://ktla.com/2015/06/30/gov-brown-signs-law-ending-personal-religious-exemptions-to-school-vaccine-requirements/\">recent legislation in California</a> that removed the personal-belief exemption from public health vaccination programmes. </p> <p>Carrey’s tweet was posted on Instagram by Echols’ aunt Elizabeth Welch. Carrey wrote: “A trillion dollars buys a lot of expert opinions. Will it buy you? TOXIN FREE VACCINES, A REASONABLE REQUEST!” accompanied by a picture of Echols. Welch accused Carrey of using the post to “mock” him and and his family, and that vaccinations played no part in his condition.</p> <p>Karen Echols followed up with a direct appeal to Carrey asking him to remove the picture. The tweet was deleted and Carrey apologised in a subsequent message.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Karen Echols tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JimCarrey&quot;&gt;@JimCarrey&lt;/a&gt; Please remove this photo of my son.

an on-stage conversation with Goldie Hawn. He claimed that Hawn was an exception to the rule because she herself didn’t “think” she was attractive. Hawn, for her part, confessed to thinking of herself as an “ugly duckling”. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/03/former-disney-ceo-its-hard-to-find-a-beautiful-woman-whos-also-funny\">Former Disney CEO: it's hard to find a beautiful woman who's also funny</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a statement, Eisner said: “In the context of a public conversation with Goldie Hawn in which I was complimenting her on being both beautiful and funny, I said such a combination is hard to come by in Hollywood. I certainly did not say Goldie was the only one. My point was simply that Goldie, unlike many, has not been defined exclusively as one or the other.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/03/former-disney-ceo-its-hard-to-find-a-beautiful-woman-whos-also-funny\">During the original conversation</a>, Eisner added: “I know women who have been told they’re beautiful, they win Miss Arkansas, they don’t ever have to get attention other than with their looks. So they don’t tell a joke. In the history of the motion-picture business, the number of beautiful, really beautiful women — a Lucille Ball — that are funny, is impossible to find.”</p> <p>Eisner, who held the senior position at Disney from 1984 to 2005, later received criticism from prominent Hollywood figures such as the producer Megan Ellison and Inside Out actor Mindy Kaling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mindykaling/statuses/617203319316967424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/meganeellison\">@meganeellison</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/THR\">@THR</a> this was said at an &quot;ideas festival&quot;.

Mike is an XXL hit with women but why did it turn men off?","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T20:18:47Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Magic Mike XXL, the sequel to Steven Soderbergh’s 2012 surprise summer smash Magic Mike, has been ruled out as a disappointment at the domestic box-office after grossing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/06/jurassic-world-magic-mike-terminator-genisys-box-office\">$28.7m over its first weekend</a>, compared to the $39.1m opening of the original.</p> <p>If you’re a male in America, you’re likely to blame, as women made up a whopping 96% of the audience over the holiday weekend, a staggering figure that <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-terminator-genisys-magic-806707\">the Hollywood Reporter</a> said is “unheard of”. It marks a substantial increase from the the first film, which attracted a 73% female audience over its opening weekend.</p> <p>Singled out, the female turnout can be seen as a win for the film’s distributor Warner Bros, but it’s no doubt the lack of a male audience also contributed to Magic Mike XXL’s disappointing weekend figure.</p> <p>Why did the sequel scare men off, while the first connected? Here are some possible reasons:<br /></p> <h2><strong>The marketing</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLoyU3xYwbs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLoyU3xYwbs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The chest-baring posters for Magic Mike teased a male-stripper comedy with flesh on its mind. The full-length trailer hinted at something much more: a timely relationship comedy about a stripper who fancies himself as an entrepreneur, just hustling to get by in tough financial times. Like the film itself, the trailer for Magic Mike favors witty exchanges over nudity.</p> <p>In contrast, XXL promises (and delivers) a sequel tailor-made for audiences disappointed by the lack of stripping in the original by featuring plenty of just that. The trailer completely ignores XXL’s central love story between Channing Tatum and Amber Heard’s character in favor of the promise of a good, naked time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/29/magic-mike-xxl-review-strippers-channing-tatum\">Magic Mike XXL review: like watching pained strippers dryhump</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Critical reception</strong></h2> <p>Critics for the most part were more favourable to Soderbergh’s original than they were to the underperforming sequel. The original stands at <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/magic_mike/\">80% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes</a>; XXL is <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/magic_mike_xxl/\">currently down at 64%</a>. Film critics are (unfortunately) a predominantly male breed, and the first film indisputably caters more to a (straight) male audience than the fan-serving sequel, which features more stripping and less musings on the nasty nature of capitalism.</p> <h2><strong>Lack of Matthew McConaughey</strong></h2> <p>At the time of Magic Mike’s release, the Texas-born actor was experiencing a career resurgence following standout dramatic performances in Killer Joe and Mud. That comeback continued on rolling, and landed him his first Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club, a year after Magic Mike hit theaters. His participation in Magic Mike lent the project critical heft that the sequel unfortunately lacks.</p> <h2><strong>Steven Soderbergh no longer in director’s seat</strong></h2> <p>Magic Mike marked one of the final films Soderbergh directed before “retiring” from directing further features, a factor that no doubt led to his fans showing up in support. Having Soderbergh at the helm promised a male-stripper movie with brains, and the director delivered on that. Soderbergh is back as executive producer on XXL and served as the film’s director of photography (under the alias Peter Andrews) and editor (as Mary Ann Bernard), but his name seldom appeared in marketing or reviews for the film. XXL was directed by Soderbergh’s longtime assistant director Gregory Jacobs.</p> <h2><strong>The competition<br /></strong></h2> <p>The first Magic Mike didn’t have to contend with another hit at the box office when it first opened on 29 June 2012. Its only major competition at the time of release was Ted and Pixar’s Brave – both hits, but nowhere near as major as Jurassic World or Inside Out.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Five reasons why a bare-chested Channing Tatum and company couldn’t save the sequel from a disappointing holiday weekend at the US box office<br>","headline":"Magic Mike is an XXL hit with women but why did it turn men off?","byline":"Nigel M Smith","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adzq","wordcount":"561","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436207615409/f1b4d753-278a-4a26-9e39-24fca8e72e1e-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-09T16:15:00-04:00","standfirst":"<p>Five reasons why a bare-chested Channing Tatum and company couldn’t save the sequel from a disappointing holiday weekend at the US box office<br></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/06/magic-mike-xxl-attracts-women-scares-men-box-office","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/jul/06/magic-mike-xxl-attracts-women-scares-men-box-office","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/magic-mike-xxl","webTitle":"Magic Mike XXL","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/magic-mike-xxl","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/magic-mike-xxl","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/film-industry","webTitle":"Film industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film-industry","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nigel-m-smith","webTitle":"Nigel M Smith","r2ContributorId":"70661","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436214332973/Nigel-M-Smith.jpg","firstName":"msmith","lastName":"nigel","twitterHandle":"nigelmfs","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nigel M Smith the Guardian's entertainment writer, based in Los Angeles.

The magazine championed rock’n’roll when Elvis was shocking the establishment, introduced the world to the Smiths and Joy Division and in 1979 put all-female punk group the Slits on the cover, stripped off and covered with mud.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/06/nme-free-magazine\">Will NME hit the right note as a free magazine?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But after a decade-long decline in sales, the title, which has been published weekly since 1952, is to become a free magazine, a move described by one industry expert as “the last throw of the dice”.</p> <p> In an effort to reach a broader audience, the independent music magazine, will also branch further into topics such as fashion, film, television, politics, gaming and technology. </p> <p> The move, which has been rumoured for several months, is an attempt to navigate the torrid conditions of the consumer magazine market, which had caused sales to decline to just 15,000. From September, 300,000 copies of the magazine will be distributed free of charge in the hope it will boost advertising revenue and ensure its continued survival in print as well as online.</p> <p> NME’s editor, Mike Williams, said: “We’re not viewing it as the move that will save NME, it is more that over the years NME has been on the front foot in terms of innovation. We launched NME.com in the mid-90s when there weren’t many websites out there, certainly not music websites, so it’s always been about evolution. It’s no secret that our circulation has been in decline for a long time.</p> <p> “Obviously as a knock-on effect of that, the print magazine is going to change. But ultimately we are going to stand for the same thing, which is discovery and enthusiasm for new music and new film and being part of the conversation that our audience is having.” </p> <p> The magazine – whose initials stand for New Musical Express – has played a pivotal role in both the independent and mainstream music scenes over its six decades of publication. </p> <p>Early readers of the magazine included John Lennon, Malcolm McLaren and T Rex frontman Marc Bolan, while its writers have included Bob Geldof and Pretenders lead singer Chrissie Hynde. The British film director Michael Winner was NME’s film critic in the 1950s and 60s. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>The real danger is that they dilute the brand ... It's the last throw of the dice</p> <footer> <cite>Douglas McCabe</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The publication also launched the career of photographer and film-maker Anton Corbijn, who photographed artists including Bob Dylan, the Slits, David Bowie and Joy Division for the magazine’s cover. </p> <p>Yet it has not always been smooth sailing for NME. The first front cover of the magazine, on Friday 7 March 1952, featured the Goons, Big Bill Bronzy and Ted Heath. It cost just sixpence the produce, but was initially a failure and founder Maurice Kinn had to borrow money from his mother-in-law to keep the magazine afloat.</p> <p>The 1970s are still seen as the golden age of NME – a time when, famously, the staff used to start the day by passing round a joint, and sales reached 300,000. It was also the time when Tony Parsons and Julie Birchill joined the magazine, both after answering an advert calling for “hip, young gunslingers”, and spent much of their time covering Britain’s emerging punk scene. </p> <p>Recalling her days at NME, Burchill once wrote: “At the time, working for NME was all enormously impressive – as a 17-year-old virgin from the provinces I had a good excuse to be impressed by this rubbish. If Robert Plant bought journalists half a shandy they thought it was fantastic. But no one had any money. The bands were living on a fiver a week and we weren’t paid anything.”<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47fef88355804975dffef1ec32e7cf02223b99b8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/47fef88355804975dffef1ec32e7cf02223b99b8/0_7_1559_935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Controversial 2007 cover featuring naked Beth Ditto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Controversial 2007 magazine cover featuring naked Gossip singer Beth Ditto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NME</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other memorable moments from NME’s back issues include a 1988 interview with Nick Cave, during which he threw his cowboy boots at the interviewer and tried to destroy his dictaphone, and the controversy caused by a 2007 front cover featuring Gossip singer Beth Ditto naked. </p> <p>The decision to make NME free comes at a time when the magazine industry as a whole is struggling. ‘Lads’ titles Nuts and Loaded closed last year, while fashion-focussed Company magazine recently went online-only. Coupled with a shift in the way audiences access music, the past decade has been particularly tough on NME. </p> <p>However, various industry experts and former NME writers have expressed trepidation at the changes announced on Monday, both to make the magazine free and to move it away from its core remit of indie music coverage.</p> <p>Douglas McCabe, a media industry analyst at Enders, said the announcement was “quite extraordinary”.</p> <p> “My instinct is to feel quite concerned about it,” he said. “When you look at other magazines that have gone free, like Time Out, the reason they’ve been a great success was because they didn’t have to adapt very much. It was a magazine that readers already understood and already had broad cultural interest – whereas NME will have to work very hard to move away from becoming a niche interest title. So in my view they’ve built up a relatively challenging proposition.”</p> <p>With broad-reaching free publications such as Time Out, Stylist and Shortlist already covering fashion, technology and film, McCabe was also unconvinced that there was an appetite for NME to cover the same topics. Williams refused to confirm whether NME would be hiring new staff with expertise in fields other than music.</p> <p>Branching into areas such as politics would not be new territory for the magazine, which has a long history of campaigning for issues such as gay rights and nuclear disarmament. In the week before the 1987 UK election, NME even put Neil Kinnock on its cover.</p> <p>But McCabe warned against alienating the millions of young readers who still visit the NME website and see it as the go to source for indie music news. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>It is going to be very, very difficult for them to reposition themselves as anything other than a specialist music title</p> <footer> <cite>Hamish MacBain</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“The real danger is that they dilute the brand that causes them more problems strategically in the longer term, rather than cementing the reputation of the brand,” he said. “It’s the last throw of the dice.” </p> <p>Former NME writer Hamish MacBain, who worked at the magazine for over seven years before becoming deputy editor of free magazine Shortlist, also expressed his concerns about the longevity of the move. </p> <p>“It is going to be very, very difficult for them to reposition themselves as anything other than a specialist music title,” said MacBain. “Certainly they can cover film and technology and fashion as they always have in some capacity, but it seems to me those will always be a secondary concern. I think it is going to be a struggle for them to be seen by readers and advertisers as a credible source of commentary and information on film and fashion and all these other non-music areas ahead of the other titles that already exist.”</p> <p>Recalling his own introduction to the magazine as a 15-year-old living in Derbyshire, an hour away from any record shop, MacBain said that main issues would be making sure the teenage target audience still had access to the magazine once it went free.</p> <p>He said: “The way people listen to and read about music has changed so immeasurably over the past 15 years or so, so this is a case of adapt or die. But the problem with NME is that the core target audience is 15-, 16-year-old kids who live in the middle of suburbia who are getting into music and use the magazine as a portal to get into that world. These are not people who are at Tube stations every day.” </p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Magazine will also branch out into TV and film, fashion, politics, gaming and tech in a move described as the ‘last throw of the dice’","headline":"Sink or swim for NME as long-running music weekly goes free from September","byline":"Hannah Ellis-Petersen","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adnk","wordcount":"1297","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/aa4652a32cae66c2460f2c1715b5f6a567070995/0_235_2816_1689/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-09T20:30:00+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Magazine will also branch out into TV and film, fashion, politics, gaming and tech in a move described as the ‘last throw of the dice’</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/sink-or-swim-for-nme-as-long-running-magazine-becomes-free-from-september","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2015/jul/06/sink-or-swim-for-nme-as-long-running-magazine-becomes-free-from-september","sectionName":"Music","tags":[{"id":"music/nme","webTitle":"NME","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/nme","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/nme","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","sectionName":"Television & radio","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"media/magazines","webTitle":"Magazines","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/magazines","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/magazines","sectionName":"Media","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/media","sectionName":"Media","references":[]},{"id":"media/pressandpublishing","webTitle":"Newspapers & magazines","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/pressandpublishing","sectionName":"Media","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/hannah-ellis-petersen","webTitle":"Hannah Ellis-Petersen","r2ContributorId":"62979","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/17/1424182411132/Hannah-Ellis-Petersen.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/17/1424182428491/Hannah-Ellis-Petersen-L.png","firstName":"hannah","lastName":"ellis-petersen","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Hannah Ellis-Petersen is the Guardian's culture reporter.

Jordan obituary","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T17:12:50Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>My father, John Jordan, who has died aged 74 after a long illness, was a sound recordist on many television programmes, including Blue Peter and the Morecambe and Wise show, in the 1960s and 70s. He also worked on Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange (1971), which was nominated for a Bafta for sound.</p> <p>He was born in Hertfordshire to Ruth and Cecil Jordan, both social workers. After boarding at Ackworth school, in Yorkshire, he was offered several university places but opted to do a four-year sandwich course with Siemens, based in Woolwich, south London. He then went to work as an electrical engineer for Livingston Laboratories, which also ran a small documentary film company called Livingston Studios, based in Barnet, north London. This was where John learned how to light, compose, record, mix and edit. It sparked a passion for film, in particular the magic of sound.</p> <p>John was soon in demand for all sorts of television programmes. He worked on documentary films, such as the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969 and a film about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/18/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">Edward Heath</a>, then prime minister, racing his boat, Morning Cloud. He also worked with the singer James Taylor and with the Beatles. But we three boys, his sons, were more interested in his stories of hanging out of helicopters with John Noakes of Blue Peter over Salisbury Plain.</p> <p>One of his favourite assignments was recording Beethoven’s opera Fidelio in the Theater an der Wien in 1970, with the conductor Leonard Bernstein. He often talked about hearing every creak made by footsteps on the stage in this old building. The programme was awarded an Emmy.</p> <p>After his achievements with Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange, John was approached by Staffordshire University to set up and run a department of audio/visual communication. He was an inspirational and much loved teacher and mentor. His philosophy was never to tell students what to do or think – but to let them discover things for themselves.</p> <p>When John arrived in Staffordshire he enlisted the support of the university and the British film industry to found <a href=\"http://www.stokefilmtheatre.org.uk\" title=\"\">Stoke Film theatre</a>. It continues to flourish, the only self-financing regional film theatre in Britain. Last year it celebrated its 40th anniversary.</p> <p>John was a life-long Quaker. In retirement he oversaw the restoration of a 17th-century listed Quaker Meeting House in Leek, Staffordshire.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Grace, his sons, Andrew, Daniel and me, and his four grandchildren.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Other lives:</strong> Sound recordist on popular TV shows such as Blue Peter and Morecambe and

Elfman: 'It was the most intense fear I've felt in my career'","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T17:04:30Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.johnmauceri.com/\">John Mauceri</a> had an idea. He had conducted the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra for 16 years, and was well-versed in the music of films. He and composer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/02/danny-elfman-tim-burton-singing\">Danny Elfman</a> had worked together when Mauceri had conducted the orchestra on some of Elfman’s work from his long, illustrious, almost symbiotic relationship with director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/dec/19/tim-burton-on-big-eyes-a-weird-symbolic-version-of-the-american-dream-video-interview\">Tim Burton</a>. The music got Mauceri thinking: what if they mixed Burton’s artwork, fresh from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/mar/11/tim-burton-moma-exhibition\">a retrospective at Museum of Modern Art in New York City</a>, with the music it inspired?</p> <p>According to Mauceri, Elfman had never been particularly comfortable with live performance of his orchestral works. “He records it, supervises it, produces it, and then moves on to something else.” But when they approached Elfman about the multimedia performance, to Mauceri’s surprise, Elfman said yes.</p> <p>Elfman says that when he was approached to do the stage concert, he was both excited and terrified. (A feeling he was used to: after he sent the score for Pee-wee’s Big Adventure – the first collaboration between Elfman and Burton – the composer was convinced Warner Brothers would simply throw his work in the trash never to be heard again.) “I had been approached about doing these concerts for 20 years, but I didn’t have time. It was too much work – I didn’t like thinking backwards,” Elfman said. “But then I finally thought: ‘It’s now or never.’”</p> <p>The resulting show, which is factually if not eloquently titled <a href=\"http://www.lincolncenterfestival.org/2015/danny-elfman-s-music-from-the-films-of-tim-burton\">Danny Elfman’s Music from the Films of Tim Burton</a>, had popular runs in London, Los Angeles and Tokyo, and will finally come to New York City, taking over Lincoln Center from 6-12 July. The show features music from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/frankenweenie\">Frankenweenie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/87108/beetlejuice\">Beetlejuice</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487/reference\">Edward Scissorhands</a> and many more films rearranged by Elfman to be performed by a live orchestra, paired with a series of visual images chosen by Burton himself, and with the composer stepping into the limelight to sing highlights from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/17/musical.timburton\">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>.</p> <p>For Mauceri, Elfman’s willingness to sing was a sign of his commitment to the project. “That changed everything,” Mauceri said. “It gave the concert a kind of imprimatur of the composer, who’s actually there, performing his music, and having arranged it, and trusting us to interpret it.”</p> <p>That wasn’t the only surprise that Elfman had in store for Mauceri. “Danny himself decided that he would create the orchestral suites that we would play. He did not farm it out to other people; he did not use pre-existing materials that orchestras might have played over the years.” </p> <p>The only problem was that Elfman had no idea how to compose an orchestral suite. That had never stopped him before, though. “I had no music lessons and no training. I came in out of the blue, which is why I caught so much shit in Hollywood for so many years,” Elfman said. “When I first started writing songs with Tim for Nightmare Before Christmas, neither of us had any clue how to make a musical. We just started doing some songs. Starting on this stage show was like that. I just started.”</p> <p>He carved out four months from his packed schedule and set about reconfiguring some of his best-known film scores – <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/reference\">Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/reference\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/25/alice-in-wonderland-film-review\">Alice in Wonderland</a> and The Nightmare Before Christmas among them – for the orchestra. “I didn’t know what the correct way to do anything was,” said Elfman, who transformed 15 film scores into suites to fill a two-hour performance. “It was a great challenge and the big surprise was that it wasn’t a disaster.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jMGp41cTEY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jMGp41cTEY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Danny Elfman and co perform.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As he worked, he quickly realised that some of his scores, like Alice in Wonderland, were easy to translate, but earlier works like Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice were much more difficult to sculpt into orchestral suites. “They needed to be taken apart, because they didn’t work just being plunked on the stage,” said Elfman. “I had heard parts of Batman, Beetlejuice, and Pee-wee in other concerts and generally I hated them. The first time I heard Pee-wee live on stage, I realised half of it was piano and the strings were just sitting there. In the film it’s fine, but onstage there’s nothing happening. I had just never imagined playing it live.”</p> <p>Now Elfman knows there is a different way to approach writing for film as opposed to writing for concerts. “The best way I can describe it is if I have a whole orchestra playing, but I want to hear a single clarinet, on a film I just move up a microphone. In a concert, I have to carve out the space for it to play within the 85 pieces of orchestra surrounding it. I really had to reconceive each piece to get the energy of what we hear coming out of the speakers on the screen into the concert.”</p> <p>Finally, Elfman was done. With the show arranged, the team headed to London for the premiere. Elfman, though, had not been able to actually hear his suites performed yet. He finally heard an orchestra play his suites two days before the London premiere, but there was no time to make any changes other than to rectify a few printing errors. </p> <p>“I had no idea if it was going to work on any level. And I had flippantly agreed to sing. I hadn’t sung in 17 years! I had never even sung the songs all the way through,” he says. “It was the most intense fear I had ever felt in my career, but Helena Bonham-Carter was there to sing Sally’s song and she said: ‘I know what you’re thinking, but just fuck it.’ I thought about it and said: ‘Yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing my whole life,’ and I went out there and did it,” Elfman said. “I thought I would have to win over the London audience, but they were great. It is one of the most moving live experiences I’ve had.”</p> <p>When Danny Elfman’s Music from the Films of Tim Burton comes to Lincoln Center for its run of shows, opening night will mark his 25<sup>th</sup> concert. So Elfman has worked out his performance anxiety, although playing in front of a New York audience comes with its own set of nerves. “I haven’t played in New York since that USO show I did for the troops in world war two,” joked Elfman. “So I haven’t played in New York in a long time. I hope they’ll be kind.”</p> <ul> <li>Danny Elfman’s Music from the Films of Tim Burton conducted by John Mauceri will be part of <a

obituary","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T16:06:10Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>My husband, Terry Staples, who has died aged 75, was a teacher and one of the driving forces behind popular weekend screenings for children at the National Film Theatre in the 1980s.</p> <p>Terry was born in Eastbourne, East Sussex. His father, Fred, had reserved occupation status as a carpenter during the second world war and travelled all over the country repairing bomb-damaged buildings. His mother, Doris, was determined to keep the family together so they all travelled with Fred, staying in lodgings. The family returned to Eastbourne after the war.</p> <p>Like millions of other children, Terry enjoyed going to the Saturday morning pictures – in his case at the Luxor in Eastbourne. Sixty years later, he published <a href=\"http://www.euppublishing.com/book/9780748607181\" title=\"\">All Pals Together</a> (Edinburgh University Press 1997), a meticulously researched history of children’s cinema in Britain, which remains a standard text on this subject. Through research for this book he came across the story of the Barnsley public hall disaster of 1908, during which 16 children were killed in a crush at a film screening. Shortly before his death he was working on A Song for Little Children, a play based on the inquest into the tragedy.</p> <p>After studying at the University of Birmingham and teaching English in South Korea for two years, Terry then taught the subject in several London secondary schools during the 1960s and it was during this time that we met.</p> <p>We married in 1972 and Terry became head of English at Holloway school, Islington, where he led one of the Inner London Education Authority’s five local English centres. In 1979, when I was offered a job at the British Film Institute, we agreed that I would work while Terry would look after our two young children – an unusual choice at that time.</p> <p>Having run school film clubs, Terry was invited in 1982 to develop weekend screenings for children at the National Film Theatre (now BFI Southbank). For the next 18 years, he programmed a huge variety of contemporary, historical and world cinema, attended and introduced every screening, and wrote all the programme notes in child-friendly language.</p> <p>The popularity of “Junior NFT” proved that, far from being scared off by subtitles or unfamiliar material, children love to discover films that are new to them. From 1989 to 1992 Terry also curated the London Children’s film festival, through which he introduced British audiences to important directors such as Abbas Kiarostami and Hayao Miyazaki.</p> <p>In the 90s Terry returned to teaching, this time in adult education, running access courses at City and Islington College. People who saw themselves as educational failures, or had recently arrived in the UK and needed qualifications to be able to work here, gained confidence, skills and academic success through his efforts.</p> <p>Terry is survived by me, his children, Bennett and Phoebe, and his grandchildren, Morgan, Alfie and Connie.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Other lives:</strong> Teacher and driving force behind popular weekend screenings for children at the National Film

<p>Paramount’s method of spinning the hot mess that is Terminator Genisys is telling. When it became clear on Friday night that the film’s debut at the US box office was going to be seriously under par, the studio stopped using previous Terminator films as comparison points and opted instead for 2011’s Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol – a yardstick that, other than the fact that both are PG-13 action films, seems rather arbitrary in terms of tone and cinematic heritage. What Paramount didn’t want widely pored over was that, even unadjusted for inflation, $28.7m is the lowest Terminator opening since the low-budget original’s $4m in 1984. Instead, they were able to point to a result almost on par with Ghost Protocol – and more importantly, imply that Genisys, with $155m in costs and a reported two sequels in the works, will also rally abroad (almost 70% of Ghost Protocol’s $694.7m was made overseas).<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/jul/03/amy-magic-mike-terminator-genisys-magician-reviews-guardian\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4abpp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2331313\"            data-video-name=\"The Guardian film show live: Amy, Terminator Genisys, Magic Mike XXL and Orson Welles – video reviews\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/3/1435920840528/KP_339196_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457398607\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/3/1435920837186/KP_339196_crop_1200x720.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/03/150702TGFSmain_1_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/03/150702TGFSmain_1_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/03/150702TGFSmain_1_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/03/150702TGFSmain_1.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/03/150702TGFSmain_1_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch a review of Terminator Genisys</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Unfortunately for the many who disagree with James Cameron’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/09/james-cameron-terminator-genisys-official-third-film-saga\">baffling endorsement</a> and regard the fifth Terminator as a self-digesting series nadir, Paramount’s projection looks feasible. At least based on this week’s set of openings in 36 markets, where Genisys has been significantly outstripping Ghost Protocol. Whether it will go on to $700m is another matter, but a not-unrealistic $400m should ensure the series’ continuation. (Terminator 3 managed $433.4m; Terminator Salvation, $371.4m.) Disheartening it may be for critics of Hollywood’s current fondness for strip-mining intellectual property, but this is the modern box-office switcheroo par excellence: leaning on emerging markets – where fealty to relics of the star system such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Cruise is strongest – to prop up degraded franchises. </p> <p>As in the US, Genisys has dropped off compared to previous Terminators in developed economies such as the UK and France. But in smaller emerging markets, such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Venezuela, it is setting highs for both the franchise and for Schwarzenegger. And the bigger emerging markets – which probably had big enough screen counts in 1991 for Terminator 2 to make its mark – are still showing strong enough growth for the franchise: most impressively, Russia (T3: $4.1m; Salvation: $7.9m; Genisys: $12.5m), Mexico (T3: $4.6m; Salvation: $2.6m; Genisys: $6.2m), Brazil (Salvation: $2.1m; Genisys: $4m). Unlike time travel, some rules of the box office seem depressingly unbendable.<br /></p> <h2>Wuxia revival</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY00f9yH130\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dY00f9yH130?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A Chinese martial arts movie hasn’t broken out internationally in nearly a decade, since The Curse of the Golden Flower, the last in Zhang Yimou’s trilogy of kung fu epics, hit the US in December 2006. That’s despite admirable domestic openings in the meantime for the likes of 2013’s Journey to the West ($92.4m) and 2014’s The Monkey King ($50.9m). But a firm $28m No 1 start in China for Monk Comes Down the Mountain could augur a return to those early-noughties glory days, which were kicked off by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’s $213.5m worldwide take in 2001. Also co-produced by Sony-Columbia, the film, which stars Wang Baoquiang, from Chinese indie mega-hit Lost in Thailand, as the titular monk forced to leave his Taoist temple, looks to be a return to the comparatively realistic, literary-derived <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia\">wuxia</a> of Crouching Tiger. </p> <p>It’s the rowdy supernatural variety, fuelled by Chinese mythology that perhaps limits its overseas prospects, which has dominated the Chinese box office recently. Like Yimou’s trilogy, Monk Comes Down the Mountain is helmed by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/21/3\">Fifth Generation</a> legend: Chen Kaige, of Farewell My Concubine renown. Wong Kar-wai’s The Grandmaster, which managed a respectable $6.6m US grab, hinted at a return for arty chop-socky last year, and Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s The Assassin <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia\">wowed at Cannes in May</a>. No release dates in the west have been set for Monk Comes Down the Mountain, but are presumably forthcoming with Sony guiding things. This could be a chance for the supposed cinematic powerhouse China to resume exports of its most popular genre and get back on the global scoreboard.<br /></p> <h2>Grin and bare it</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/magic-mike-xxl-naked-truth-dreamboy-strippers\">Magic Mike XXL – strippers' verdict: 'A public liability claim waiting to happen'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oh, Mike, what happened? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwPR0q5es0A\">Raunchy trailers</a> hyped the crowd hard for the return of Tampa’s premier male entertainer, and reviews suggested a sizeable section of the critical community were in the mood, too. But when it came time for sequel Magic Mike XXL to whip everything off, it proved more Magic Mike XXS, its $12m US debut looking rather flaccid next to its 2012 predecessor’s $39.1m. The audience was notably 96% female, against Magic Mike’s 73%, suggesting Warner Bros’ promotional efforts – bigging up the bump’n’grind at the expense of virtually any dramatic interest – had worked too well, destroying any consensus appeal. Plus, Steven Soderbergh’s central involvement lent the first film the curious allure of one of America’s most respected directors edifying trashy material; with him (as pseudonymous DoP and editor) merely oiling up new director Gregory Jacobs this time, the sequel had more of an air of smash-and-grab exploitation. </p> <p>With the original’s box-office takings so heavily (68%) US-centric, it’ll be hard for XXL to pump it up internationally – though it took $6.2m from 15 territories in this frame. Luckily, the $14.7m budget (double the first’s) means this is no catastrophe – except perhaps for headliner Channing Tatum. On the back of Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, he was looking like a bona fide star in 2012, but the twin failures of XXL and Jupiter Ascending this year cast serious doubt over his efficacy as a leading man. Or, at least, over his choice of projects. He’s that quintessential 21st-century A-list head-scratcher: great as an added franchise element, or in partnership with another big-hitter; risky on his own.<br /></p> <h2>Beyond Hollywood</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9frx_v7KUQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9frx_v7KUQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>China’s Hollywood moratorium is still in force until the end of July, so local pictures – including Monk Comes Down the Mountain and, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/29/global-box-office-ted-2-minions-jurassic-world\">already covered in previous columns</a>, Hollywood Adventures and SPL 2 – are having the run of it. Joining them, with a $4.2m take putting it in 14th spot globally, was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFYHKFp9MZU\">I Am Somebody</a>, Derek Yee’s docudrama-ish peek at fame-hungry wannabes at Hengdian World Studios (inevitably dubbed Chinawood). Korean thriller <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IYnBYSsqy0\">NLL: Battle of Yeonpyeong</a>, in ninth place globally, continued to mine north-south paranoia and held extremely well for another $8m, planting it inside the annual top 10 in Korea. Hollywood – with Kingsman and Age of Ultron over-performing there – has been doing very well in 2015, but NLL is another dart in the board for one of its most formidable local competitors. And clocking in at 12th globally with the best opening ($6.8m) for a local title in France this year was<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9frx_v7KUQ\"> Les Profs 2</a>, followup to the $32.5m-grossing comedy about a group of teachers who rescue the worst <em>lycée</em> in France. The same UGC production outfit which turned out 2014’s ($104.6m) top film, the multicultural wedding comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VLN6LPXK_w\">Qu’Est-Ce Qu’On A Fait au Bon Dieu?</a>, sends these <em>profs</em> to the one place where sequel mirth is guaranteed: England. Hey, we’ve done it to them plenty of times.</p> <h2>The future</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NQRhE772b0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NQRhE772b0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There is no major new Hollywood product being stacked next week – just further shelves of Terminator Genisys, Magic Mike XXL, Inside Out and, most significantly, Minions. The latter, going great guns in the 26 territories already in play, gets its US opening, as well as openings in France, Mexico and Russia. Which leaves room in China for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2FdzS9DdQU\">Tiny Times 4</a>, the fourth instalment in three years of the massively successful saga swooning over the work and love lives of young, moneyed Shanghai urbanites. </p> <p>The presumably moneyed Guo Jingming, on whose novels the series is based, writes and directs again, and will be hoping to beat the last film’s $82.3m. And India gets its own Avatar moment with the release of SS Rajamouli’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NQRhE772b0\">Baahubali</a> – which, depending on how you measure it, could be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/26/baahubali-film-bollywood-tamil-telugu-language\">the country’s most expensive production ever</a>. Budgeted at $40m across two parts, this pristine-looking epic about two royal brothers’ struggle over an ancient kingdom is certainly up there on India’s big-spenders list – which surprisingly is mostly filled with Tamil-language works, not Bollywood Hindi works (Baahubali is filmed in both Tamil and Telugu). Rajamouli has a reputation as one of the Telugu industry’s leading lights: his previous film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbWURFD4vdE\">Eega (The Fly)</a>, told the story of a man reincarnated as a house fly who must avenge his own murder.

In it, he played a soccer star who falls for Amanda Bynes’ character, Viola, who’s masquerading as her brother so she can play soccer. It’s funny, it’s smart, and it’s a pretty interesting teen film. (Especially since it depicts the fluidity of gender in a relatively mature way.)</p> <p>That same year Tatum also starred in Step Up, and in 2008 he made a cameo in Step Up 2: The Streets, proving his can-do, up-for-anything attitude – mainly because we all know nobody from original dance movies tends to show up for lower-budgeted sequels, unless you’re a legitimate team player.</p> <p>But if generations of actors have proven anything, Tatum’s trajectory should have looked different. We’ve seen how many teen stars grow up to work consistently as adults but fail to grab the metaphorical brass ring. They play the comic relief, but never the superhero. They’re the indie darling, but never the big-budget star. They pop up in AMC series or on network dramas, but hardly work the late night show circuit. Tatum is one of a handful of actors who have owned their teen selves and sprung into superstardom. He is arguably part of an anomaly. But how?</p> <p>“I think the biggest indicator towards Channing’s success is that he appeals to so many people,” said culture journalist Chris Mandle. “He’s incredibly good looking, but he tests equally well with men and women. Straight guys like him because he’s an action hero and a leading man, and he’s someone they can aspire to be like or hang out with. But he has a huge gay fanbase too, because not only is he hot and boyish but he’s also funny and goofy, and probably loves pizza.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/magic-mike-xxl-naked-truth-dreamboy-strippers\">Magic Mike XXL – strippers' verdict: 'A public liability claim waiting to happen'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also noted his rise to prominence has come as his projects (the Jump Street franchise, Magic Mike and Foxcatcher) have challenged the “preconceptions of him as a dull beefcake dude”.</p> <p>And those preconceptions were a mistake. On top of She’s the Man boldly exploring gender norms (a big feat for teen films in 2006 and, let’s face it, even now), Mandle noted that Jump Street saw Tatum’s character realize jock tropes make him irrelevant (and problematic) outside his circle. Meanwhile, Foxcatcher is an exploration of the conflict that arises from the myth of male masculinity and bravado. Even Magic Mike explores the idea of manhood in an unconventional way, using exotic dancing as a template for examining what makes a man just that. These roles point to an actor who’s more than just That Guy Who Starred In That Dance Movie Once – they imply Tatum is a smart person who understands how the world works. And that, of course, makes us more forgiving about past roles in Dear John or GI Joe.</p> <p>“Tatum seems to be constantly playing himself in every role, and his joy in doing so is addictive,” suggested Stacey May Fowles, columnist for the Globe and Mail. “Fans are more forgiving of someone so human, willing to excuse poor performances or bad project choices because of how endearing he is. Even when they’re on a pedestal of fame, we find ourselves identifying with these actors, having fun with them and becoming excited about what they’ll do next.”</p> <p>There’s also a level of accountability.</p> <p>“Channing did a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/24/channing-tatum-gi-joe-rise-of-cobra-forced-studio\">funny interview last week</a> where he admitted he hated doing GI Joe, and a few years back that kind of behavior from a multimillionaire would look like sour grapes,” said Mandle. “But he spun it in a really smart way: ‘My hands were tied. I was a really naive kid, I just wanted to make movies.’ And remarkably, people sided with him. That’s a sign of someone who knows what he’s doing.”</p> <p>Intention isn’t just a trait exclusive to Tatum, either. Now tied to Marvel as Captain America, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/03/timeline-how-captain-america-chris-evans-got-tired-of-fame.html\">Chris Evans has been more than vocal</a> about his intention to dial down acting work following the end of his contract. But instead of complaining without actually doing anything, he took control of his trajectory by <a href=\"http://www.tiff.net/festivals/thefestival/programmes/specialpresentations/before-we-go\">making his directorial debut at TIFF last year</a> – a feat, considering Evans also got his start on the teen movie circuit with 2001’s Not Another Teen Movie, before turns in Cellular, What’s Your Number? and the Fantastic Four franchise. And yet, as box office returns – and the critical acclaim for Captain America: Winter Soldier – show, we’re all very keen to stick with him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/06/magic-mike-xxl-attracts-women-scares-men-box-office\">Magic Mike is an XXL hit with women but why did it turn men off?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I think one of the most obvious things about actors like Tatum and Evans is this basic idea that they don’t seem to take themselves all that seriously, which is a really fundamental characteristic of anyone’s longevity in any career choice,” explained Fowles. “They’re likable because they seem to be enjoying what they do, yet also appear to be treating stardom more like a job than anything else; [they’re] less than invested in the trappings of limelight.”</p> <p>That may be the key: like Tatum, Evans and Chris Pratt (who got his start on Everwood and on The OC) seem to be just doing their job. Even as recently as May, Pratt went on record saying <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/23/chris-pratt-son-jack\">he eventually hopes to leave LA so he and his wife, Anna Faris, can raise their son outside the Hollywood bubble</a>. To Huffington Post culture writer and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/two-brown-girls/id961835196?mt=2\">Two Brown Girls</a> co-creator Zeba Blay, this hardworking attitude explains why years after their questionable first roles, we still care about these guys.</p> <p>“I think the key to the longevity of these actors is that at some point, they decided to stop taking themselves seriously,” she says. “Other generations of teen stars have thought staying relevant meant trying to become the next Brando. It worked for Leo [DiCaprio], but generally no one is interested any longer in watching these guys try desperately to win an Oscar, even if they’re genuinely good actors.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4249fd8dc8e47b29d787714d75100d2780e9b0c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a4249fd8dc8e47b29d787714d75100d2780e9b0c/37_389_3340_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Channing Tatum in Foxcatcher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Channing Tatum in Foxcatcher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony Pictures/Courtesy Eve/R/Sony Pictures/Courtesy Eve/R</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Look at [James] Franco,” she said. “Look at [Zac] Efron. Even though they do the dramatic thing now and again, they understand that sometimes they have to parody themselves to make them feel more accessible. We go through all these phases of male star types, and I think at the moment we’re in this interesting time where people prefer goofy hunks. I think it’s why Chris Pratt has suddenly had this epic surge in his career. And I think Tatum recognized that early on.”</p> <p>Fowles agreed: “Perhaps given the hyper-transparency of the digital age we live in, actors like this have learned that serious artifice is something impossible to maintain, and in letting down their guard and making fun of themselves both onscreen and off they’ve got us rooting for them.</p> <p>“Disarming always has staying power, whether you’re playing a stripper or a superhero,” she adds. “And it would appear they’ve tapped into that as a method of ongoing success.”</p> <p>So maybe it’s that simple: the reason we’ve seen the propulsion of Tatum’s, Evans’ and Pratt’s careers is because, despite being actors, they’re unabashedly playing and owning themselves. Unlike former teen star Jared Leto, they never paused to start a band or attempt the avant-garde before returning to acting. Unlike former tween pinup Jonathan Taylor-Thomas, they stuck with the industry instead of going to school.</p> <p>“I feel like actors like Channing Tatum and Chris Evans have managed to maintain relevancy past their earlier youth because for once, we have a space for that age of male stars,” said HelloGiggles columnist and TV producer Erin Mallory Long. “I think in the past we’ve had tons of space for young, adorable male stars and room for grizzly older stars, and nothing in between. I think and hope this is a change also happening for female stars, but I don’t think that’s the case.</p> <p>“But I do think we’re allowing male stars to grow up and even watch them grow up a little more onscreen,” she added. “[Which] allows them to turn into adult movie stars.”</p> <p>“I think for any star, [longevity] is a combination of luck and marketing, and it also helps if you’re white and male,” said Kiva Reardon, founder of Cléo, a journal of film and feminism. “Like any career, relevancy depends on making key choices in your field, and for actors that means selecting parts that will resonate. It then comes down to spinning that and getting the right interviews at the right times. And as for the second caveat, there is an expiry date that comes sooner for women in Hollywood – and that the industry’s interest and investment in non-white characters is subpar to say the least.”</p> <p>Which is true: arguably, in conjunction with their realness, smarts and obvious work ethic, actors like Pratt, Evans and Tatum are also reaping the benefits of being white male actors in a very white and male-friendly industry. Reardon added that they may be less an anomaly than our new definition of teen actors and/or teen roles.</p> <p>“I think the reason we’re so aware of careers lasting beyond teenagehood is because that’s a relatively new bracket,” she said. “Teens really came into being in the 1950s, mainly as a new marketing means, and it’s now considered to be a crucial age. We place so much emphasis on teen years that they’re now grounded in biographies as an elemental period. So what has changed is the intensity of the star system and media industry around it – there’s always been gossip magazines, but there hasn’t been iCloud nude hacks. This creates a different dynamic for surviving in the industry, especially for women.</p> <p>“Just think of how much easier the transition to mature – often sexual – roles is for ex-Mickey Mouse Club dudes than it is for girls-not-yet-women.”</p> <p>As one noteworthy teen was once told, with great power comes great responsibility.

about Catherine the Great, the celebrated empress who ruled Russia for most of the second half of the 18th century.</p> <p>According to a statement from Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, part of the Orion Publishing Group, Jolie’s production company Jolie Pas has bought an option on Simon Sebag Montefiore’s book, Catherine the Great &amp; Potemkin: The Imperial Love Affair, which was published in 2000.</p> <p>Born in Prussia under the name Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg, Catherine became empress of Russia in 1762, after a coup against her husband, Peter III. She would go on to become the country’s longest-ruling female sovereign, dying in 1796. Potemkin was arguably the best known of her court favourites, playing a key role in Russia’s imperial ambitions in the southerly Caspian sea region, conducting a major war against the Ottoman empire and accomplishing the annexation of the Crimean peninsula. He became Catherine’s lover in 1774, shortly after the displacement of an earlier favourite, Count Orlov, and retained high office even after their affair ended. His name is associated with both the “Potemkin village” – the practice of setting up fake neighbourhoods to impress visiting VIPs – and the battleship that had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/28/battleship-potemkin-review\">a famous mutiny</a> in 1905.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/may/28/angelina-jolie-maleficent-drawn-to-evil-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3pj32\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2100332\"            data-video-name=\"Angelina Jolie on Maleficent: 'I was drawn to the evil' - video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/28/1401292392205/Angelina-Jolie-star-of-Ma-024.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-438000716\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/28/1401292389014/Angelina-Jolie-star-of-Ma-022.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent/140528Maleficent.m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Angelina Jolie on Maleficent: ‘I was drawn to the evil’ - video interview</figcaption> </figure>   <p>No details have emerged of what credits Jolie might take in the production.

The film will expand nationwide in the US on 10 July. </p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"In the UK, Asif Kapadia’s study of the late singer has charted the highest

Ritrovato: Hudson, Bergman, Keaton – a feast of film under Italian skies","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T12:23:42Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>“Technicolor is like God – it cannot be copied!” Nicola Mazzanti of the <a href=\"http://www.filmarchives-online.eu/partners/test\">Royal Belgian Film Archive</a> is introducing a screening of Douglas Sirk’s perfect melodrama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/all-heaven-allows-romance\">All That Heaven Allows</a> (1955) and, in an unexpectedly exuberant speech, he promises the crowd in Bologna’s Cinema Arlecchino “a mystical experience”. This is a screening, not from a digital cinema package (DCP) or a re-release, but an original 35mm distribution print – vintage, authentic Technicolor. Mazzanti assures us that there will be scratches (“God, I love scratches!”) and that “if we are really lucky, the film will break, the house lights will come up, and you will be discovered entwined with your girlfriend, or your boyfriend”. </p> <p>Well, we were luckier than that. The film did not break, and for 88 glorious minutes we watched Sirk’s classic as it had first been seen, with a vibrant, almost hallucinatory colour palette. Technicolor may not strictly be divine, but it is a specific chemical process, and reproductions do not quite do it justice. At the film’s climax, Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson were entwined, and the audience, revealed by the house lights, were simply agog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-da859e64-f7a9-4f02-9e44-c746288dbbf7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436185080375/61395a74-d971-46dc-89af-bad3320c91ad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/MGM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is <a href=\"http://festival.ilcinemaritrovato.it/en/\">Il Cinema Ritrovato</a>, a feast of film served once a year in this gorgeous Italian city that seems, itself, to have been printed in Technicolor – <em>la città rossa</em> under brilliant blue skies. Two thousand delegates visited the festival in 2015, cinema gourmands all, devouring a broad programme comprising 427 titles organised into 20-odd strands across eight days. The Arlecchino and Jolly movie houses, as well as the city’s rep cinema, the Lumière in the Piazzetta Pasolini, host the majority of the screenings during the day. And at night, rather bigger crowds fill the Piazza Maggiore for blockbuster screenings – 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) on 70mm say, or Casablanca (1942), introduced by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/21/isabella-rossellini-interview\">Isabella Rossellini</a>. For those who crave a really antique viewing experience, the aforementioned Piazzetta Pasolini is occasionally home to a carbon lantern projector spooling silent films of great beauty after sundown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaff3a67bf7d0150bff227c6b23d68fdf5511176\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436182784137/e5390447-3b3d-46be-9245-c3502cb9af6f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Renato Castellani’s Sotto il Sole di Roma\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renato Castellani’s Sotto il Sole di Roma (Under the Sun of Rome, 1948).</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All this in the name of what at first appears to be pure gluttony, the enjoyment of great films, in vast quantities: Japan’s first colour films; retrospectives of directors Leo McCarey and Renato Castellani; early Armenian cinema; the non-Hollywood films of Ingrid Bergman; every extant episode of Louis Feuillade’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/les-vampires-feuillade-horror\">Les Vampires</a> serial, screening daily at breakfast-time.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/cinemaritrovato2014\">Il Cinema Ritrovato</a> has a serious purpose – this festival of “found cinema” showcases recognised classics and largely unseen works, which might have been thought lost, or have been overlooked or underappreciated. Possibly the remaining prints have been damaged, or exist only in formats that are increasingly hard to project. Therefore the screenings here use an eccentric mix of media, from 4k-digital restorations to unfashionable film formats. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28e22bbcf92b6f459362c61f44e1966b28d11138\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436182930818/66554795-ec05-438a-b455-546e98a4a35c-460x344.jpeg\" alt=\"Leo McCarey’s Liberty, starring Laurel and Hardy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"344\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leo McCarey’s Liberty, starring Laurel and Hardy.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cinema may be intangible: an attempt to capture light on celluloid, or increasingly, to calibrate it in pixels, to spin still images into the illusion of movement and then to repeat the trick – endlessly. But Il Cinema Ritrovato, you could say, throws the focus on to something more tangible: either celebrating the frailty of the antique film stock, or the quality of the lab work undertaken to restore a film to a clean digital simulacrum, easily distributable to festivals and rep cinemas worldwide. Perhaps this is a kind of fetishism, or indecision: the festival is perpetually split between praising uniqueness and facilitating wider distribution.</p> <p>But Il Cinema Ritrovato is not only in the business of finding films, but of finding those aspects of films that may have been lost in translation: from Sirk’s queasily beautiful colour scheme to the additional scenes included in Castellani’s preferred edit of his prison melodrama Nella Città l’Inferno (1959), starring the incendiary Anna Magnani, to the rare chance to watch Kiss Me Kate (1953) in 3D, rather than flattened and shrunk on television.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5af71e0984fc162ad36e1b3a26e438907ff0d6e3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436183083172/cf39869b-6ee3-49dc-aa1b-0ea67ca313d2-460x348.jpeg\" alt=\"adf\" width=\"460\" height=\"348\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bitter … Ingrid Bergman in Europa ’51.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gorging on cinema in Bologna, as I was lucky enough to do this year, involves impossible decisions and incredible voyages. With so many strands and multiple venues, choosing to see one film comes at the cost of missing three or four others; but conversely, you can follow the labyrinthine schedule on a choose-your-own adventure path through cinema history. Unsurprisingly for a Hollywood classic, the Casablanca screening in the piazza was thronged, but many of those assembled could claim a newly close relationship with its star Ingrid Bergman, who was the subject of an entire strand at the festival, including gems such as her Swedish film A Woman’s Face (En Kvinnas Ansikte, 1938) in which she plays a disfigured and bitter blackmailer, or Europa ’51 (1952) in which she was directed by her husband, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/dec/01/culture.features1\">Roberto Rossellini</a>. And the director of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/casablanca-romance\">Casablanca, Michael Curtiz</a>, was represented by a real treasure: a 1914 “peasant play” called A Tolonc (The Undesirable), from back when he was called Mihály Kertész and was making silent films in his native Hungary.</p> <p>2015 marked the beginning of a new adventure for Bologna – the digital restoration and scoring of all of Buster Keaton’s silent features and shorts. <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/italys-cineteca-di-bologna-to-restore-all-of-buster-keatons-silent-films-1201454373/\">The Keaton Project</a> is a massive undertaking that will continue over several years – with the fruits of its labours being aired at each edition of Il Cinema Ritrovato. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qFXR35oBKw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qFXR35oBKw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Intricately hilarious newlywed comedy … One Week.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This year, we started with a flourish, and a double bill of Keaton’s intricately hilarious newlywed comedy One Week (1920) and his acclaimed fantasy feature Sherlock Jr (1924), screening in the piazza with perfectly timed, sprightly scores by Timothy Brock. Standing at the back of the piazza, hearing the laughter of the crowd mingle with the music, I was witness to the power of comedy to stop traffic. Cyclists winding home from the city’s bars and restaurants would pause and dismount to get a better view of Keaton careering down a dusty track, perched on the handlebars of a runaway motorcycle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC1aD7e4ZHs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cC1aD7e4ZHs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Acclaimed fantasy feature … Sherlock Jr.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>There are movie moments – such as the chase in Sherlock Jr – that repay endless repetition, as fresh each time as the last. Personal highlights of my week in Bologna included Jean Gabin playing a doomed dreamer in <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/117057689\">Julien Duvivier’s heartbreaking ensemble drama La Belle Équipe</a> (1936); Anna Pavlova fomenting revolution in Lois Weber’s epic opera adaptation The Dumb Girl of Portici (1915-16); a luscious print of Jazz on a Summer’s Day (1959), perfectly suited to the sweltering Italian heat; Charles Boyer wooing Irene Dunne in Leo McCarey’s Love Affair (1939) and the coolly captured cruelty of Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar (1965). A less well-known film, the <a href=\"http://festival.ilcinemaritrovato.it/en/film/kikos/\">Armenian tragicomedy Kikos</a> (1931), starring Ambartsum Khachanian as a reluctant soldier, was invigoratingly attractive, funny and brutal.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0fdB2RBfYs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0fdB2RBfYs?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Leo McCarey’s Love Affair (1939).</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But some of the other films that were memorable for me at this year’s Il Cinema Ritrovato offered more fleeting pleasures: the tight, San Francisco-set Woman on the Run (1950) did everything a film noir must do and no more, complete with a nightmarish fairground climax; Italian diva Valentina Frascaroli made for a haunting Jane Eyre in a sadly damaged print of Le Memorie di una Istitutrice (1917); and I enjoyed the shimmering Ruritanian bagatelle La Princesse aux Clowns (1924) far more than perhaps a grown adult should admit. Ramón Novarro’s handsome face shone in the incomplete remaining copy of Rex Ingram’s The Arab (1924), which combined gorgeous location shooting with dodgy sentiments, as far as the simultaneous translation of the Russian intertitles would allow me to understand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5fb2098dd980ea98f7ee941c1530e21d3df7a88\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436183201126/70802d9d-5953-4fbe-a98e-41f697cedc15-460x340.jpeg\" alt=\"Funny and brutal … Patvakan Barkhudaryan’s Armenian tragicomedy Kikos\" width=\"460\" height=\"340\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Funny and brutal … Patvakan Barkhudaryan’s Armenian tragicomedy Kikos.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br />It is impossible to see everything this festival offers. The choices one must make are, therefore, enjoyably agonising, and a visit to Il Cinema Ritrovato isn’t about ticking must-see titles off your cinematic bucket list. Rather, it opens up more and more possibilities of what film is, what the cinema can offer. Every time you enter the dark of the auditorium from the sun-bleached Italian streets, you might just chance on a mystical experience.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"From 2001: A Space Odyssey to the silent era via Casablanca, Bologna’s ‘found cinema’ festival serves up a magnificent range of classic and rarely seen movies","headline":"Cinema Ritrovato: Hudson, Bergman, Keaton – a feast of film under Italian skies","byline":"Pamela Hutchinson","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acq2","wordcount":"1360","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436180501994/543a54b9-63bc-45e8-b356-8ad9c5001001-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-09T13:30:00+01:00","standfirst":"<p>From 2001: A Space Odyssey to the silent era via Casablanca, Bologna’s ‘found cinema’ festival serves up a magnificent range of classic and rarely seen movies</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/06/cinema-ritrovato-bologna-film-festival-classic-rock-hudson-ingrid-bergman-buster-keaton","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/jul/06/cinema-ritrovato-bologna-film-festival-classic-rock-hudson-ingrid-bergman-buster-keaton","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/festivals","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/silent-film","webTitle":"Silent film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/silent-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/silent-film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/italy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/italy","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/busterkeaton","webTitle":"Buster Keaton","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/busterkeaton","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/busterkeaton","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"film/casablanca","webTitle":"Casablanca","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/casablanca","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/casablanca","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/pamelahutchinson","webTitle":"Pamela Hutchinson","rcsId":"GNL015940","r2ContributorId":"16216","firstName":"","lastName":"hutchinson","twitterHandle":"pamhutch","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Pamela Hutchinson is a homepage editor for the Guardian.

from an infamous abandoned Tim Burton film which would have been the director’s follow-up to Mars Attacks.</p> <p>The 1997 video shows Cage, with shoulder-length hair, trying on a sculpted, skintight electric blue bodysuit. The actor, who appears lean and athletic even without the figure-forming effect of the outfit, asks if the suit will “feel looser the more I wear it” as he tests the limits of the outfit by swinging his arms back and forth and reaching towards the ceiling.</p> <p>“There’s been stills out there from this test, and the stills don’t do it justice at all,” says Superman Lives director’s assistant Derek Frey during the video. “Initially I was really struck by how he looked in the suit. His physique, it was different to what we had seen before.”<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/31/nicolas-cage-almost-played-a-psychologically-traumatised-superman-for-tim-burton\">Nicolas Cage almost played a 'psychologically traumatised' Superman for Tim Burton</a> </p> </aside>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkRxXicAuYo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkRxXicAuYo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Concept art from the abandoned project shows a Cage-like Superman with traditional short hair, so the actor’s tresses may have been for another project. The all-blue suit – the superhero’s usual external red underpants are nowhere to be seen – is one of three which Superman would have worn during the film: there was also a black outfit, and a rainbow-effect version.</p> <p>Superman Lives was originally due to be released in 1998 but had a troubled production history featuring a number of rewrites. Cage eventually walked away in 2000 and there would not be another Superman film until 2006’s Bryan Singer-directed Superman Returns.</p> <p>The footage has been unearthed for the forthcoming documentary The Death of Superman Lives: What Happened? The crowd-funded film, which features interviews with Burton, screenwriters Kevin Smith and Dan Gilroy and costume designer Colleen Atwood, hits video on demand on 9 July.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/31/nicolas-cage-almost-played-a-psychologically-traumatised-superman-for-tim-burton\">Gilroy said in October</a> that his take centred on an alienated Superman unaware of his identity as the last son of Krypton.</p> <p>“I was very much taken by Tim’s approach, which was that Kal-El was not told by Jor-El, before he got put in the little spaceship, who he was or where he came from,” he said. “So poor little Kal-El, when he winds up on Earth, he has no freaking idea where he came from. His biggest fear is that he’s an alien.</p> <p>“He can’t commit [to Lois Lane] because he doesn’t know who he is or what is going on with him. He’s hoping that he has some physiological condition that gives him these powers but that he’s still human. It becomes very apparent, though, early in the script, when Lex Luthor uncovers the remnants of the spacecraft, he suddenly realises – ‘Oh my god, I’m an alien.’ It was all about the psychological trauma of it. I loved it.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Test footage from abandoned 1997 Tim Burton superhero film has been unearthed for a forthcoming documentary

They would be wrong.</p> <p>The scene with the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0959963/awards\">award-winning </a>Icelandic-American actor, which features in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTKBowDjMQg\"><em>A Walk Among the Tombstones,</em> starring Liam Neeson</a>, was made possible because he was attached to a crane, harness and rigging, all of which were then erased from the footage.</p> <p>The equipment had been repeatedly tested, first with heavy bags. Even so, few of us would be likely to attempt it ourselves.</p> <p>Stunt performers are increasingly working with the industry’s visual effects wizards now that more spectacular actions can be performed with safety equipment that can later be blotted out for the audience.</p> <p>Ólafsson’s stunt was organised by Mark Vanselow, a leading stuntman and coordinator, who has worked on 16 films with Neeson, the Oscar-nominated star of <em>Schindler’s List</em>, as well as on Hollywood blockbusters such as <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>.</p> <p>Vanselow said that it is now possible to stage stunts that were previously regarded as impossible, and actors can increasingly perform their own stunts, which makes the action seem more realistic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-298d19ea-dddf-4c86-8007-25c2aa8a27fc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/17/1421538090549/40a65a9f-156f-4a9e-9eae-d095d0bd6904-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sandra Bullock gravity stunt special eddefct\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Bullock in the rig, which was later digitally removed, in Gravity.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only a few years ago, he said, stunt specialists had grimly resigned themselves “to start looking for another job” because they feared that computer effects were becoming so sophisticated. They could not have been more wrong: “It actually helps us,” said Vanselow. “The computer is breathing new life into the profession.”</p> <p>Ólafsson plays a cemetery groundskeeper alongside Neeson’s character, a private investigator hired by a drug-trafficker to find out who murdered his wife.</p> <p>“I’m afraid of heights,” he said. “That was a challenge to overcome.” He credited Vanselow and his team with helping him to face it: “They tested it again and again. Mark was very careful to make sure I wasn’t being pushed.”</p> <p>Everything went into slow motion, he remembers. Just watching that scene is “scary”. Even with the safety equipment, a passerby screamed as he jumped – and can be heard in the film.</p> <p>“That’s a great example of how the special effects help us,” said Vanselow. “The audience gets to see the actual character doing the stunt – and the actor gets to go home at night. It’s not an easy thing to just jump off a building … You put a lot of trust in us.”</p> <p>Vanselow began his career as a water-skier, performing “circus on water” shows worldwide. Being a stuntman means doing “things that are fun”, he said, “like hanging under a helicopter”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a445c666be420655d2b5d5a2aec8d19b6c27c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/17/1421538486637/65e3d30c-07bd-454f-bc68-d89f4339c023-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Vanselow stuntman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Vanselow, a stuntman and stunt co-ordinator who has worked on 16 films with Liam Neeson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another Neeson film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYigQFLZmY\"><em>Seraphim Falls</em></a>, Vanselow went over a 34-metre waterfall, dropped from underneath a helicopter. “That was one of the biggest stunts I’ve done. They dropped me over the edge on a bungee rope and I disappeared into the water and popped back up.</p> <p>“I was able to do it that way because they could [blot out] the line that was holding me, whereas 20 years ago I would have had to go over without a line. They may not have been able to do that stunt at all.”</p> <p>It does, however, remain a dangerous profession. “About 99% of the time, you’re overpaid,” said Vanselow. “But then that 1% … There’s not enough money in the world. If you’re jumping off a building and something goes desperately wrong, you’re the person at the end of the wire.”</p> <p>Tim Webber, the British visual effects specialist who won an Oscar for <em>Gravity</em>, the space disaster film starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, said of Vanselow: “He’s absolutely right, judging from the amount of work we do these days that involves stuntmen, and how much I work with [them to design stunts], I’ve worked closely with stuntmen a lot more, recently.”</p> <p>Basing special effects on real action also makes a film more believable, he said. “Once you create computer-generated characters that can do absolutely anything, it loses any ‘wow factor’.”</p> <p>Vanselow said the technology is now so sophisticated that where a stunt performer has to be used they can superimpose an actor’s face over the stunt specialist’s, allowing full close-up shots.</p> <p>Andrew Lane, author of <em>Movie Stunts &amp; Special Effects</em>, said: “But a performer is always needed to form the basis of visual creations in a computer.”</p> <p><em>A Walk Among the Tombstones is released on Blu-ray and DVD on 19 January</em></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"New era in film puts the stars right back in the big scenes, and enables stunts once considered

the year that black cinema bounced back in America","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-12-25T13:00:10Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>As reports pour in about the shooting of yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2014/dec/24/black-teenager-shot-dead-by-police-in-st-louis-live-updates\">another black teenager in St Louis</a>, I was reminded of what filmmaker Ava DuVernay said a few weeks ago: “This aggression is ambient, it’s all-around, and it’s the atmosphere of people of color in this country”.</p> <p>DuVernay said these words while promoting her latest film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6t7vVTxaic\">Selma</a>, which opens tomorrow. It’s a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/05/selma-review-civil-rights-drama\">gorgeous and brave film</a> that tells the story of the 1965 marches from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/dec/17/1965-selma-montgomery-march-stephen-somerstein\">Selma to Montgomery</a>, led by Dr Martin Luther King Jr.</p> <p>When DuVernay began filming Selma this year, she could not have predicted that in August, a young unarmed black man named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Michael Brown would be shot </a>by police in Ferguson, Missouri. She could not have predicted that a grand jury would decide not to indict police officers in the death of not just Mike Brown, but also in the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>. </p> <p>And yet, Selma lands perfectly in sync with the unrest that has characterized the last few months for black America. By grounding the film in the conversations being had in America in 2014, Selma succeeds in transcending the historical drama cateogory – it’s as contemporary as ever, and as real and familiar as it could be. </p> <p>There’s a scene in the film where Martin Luther King, played by David Oyelowo, speaks to his congregation after a young black man has been shot. His fury rises as he wonders: “how many fingers were on that trigger? Every white preacher who stands silent. Every Negro who stands back.” The conversation about the silence of white Americans about racial injustice is one that is most likely taking place right now, and with nearly the same language.</p> <p>DuVernay isn’t the only black director making brave, forward-thinking cinema. She is among the leaders of a new school of black filmmakers who are creating new contemporary narratives for the black experience. DuVernay made history by becoming the first black woman to be nominated for best director at the Golden Globes; Selma is up for best picture.</p> <p>Also at the forefront of this movement are Justin Simien, the writer and director of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uag2G0J6iqw\">Dear White People</a>; Ryan Coogler, whose 2013 directorial debut, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxUJwJfcQaQ\">Fruitvale Station</a>, took home the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance; Beyond The Lights director Gina Prince-Bythewood, and, of course, British artist-turned-director Steve McQueen, whose third feature film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z02Ie8wKKRg\">12 Years A Slave</a>, won the Oscar for best picture this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b004b3243456235fd9dfcc95313f9bf12b5ac073\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b004b3243456235fd9dfcc95313f9bf12b5ac073/0_51_2712_1627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Oyelowo, center, as Martin Luther King Jr and Carmen Ejogo, right, as Coretta Scott King in Selma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simien’s film satirically explores crises in modern blackness, while Coogler’s Fruitvale Station chronicles the events that led to the death of Oscar Grant, a young black man from Oakland. McQueen’s film, 12 Years A Slave, brought slavery to audiences in brutal realism rarely seen on the screen.</p> <p>These directors are reimagining possibilities not just for black filmmakers, but for new stories to be told about the black experience – and audiences are interested. Fruitvale Station was made for the paltry sum of $900,000 and so far has made more than $17m. Simien described Dear White People’s budget as “real low”, and said that film is approaching $4.5m at the box office. And 12 Years A Slave has banked more than $185m on a $22m budget. With Oscar buzz building around Selma, it’s easy to imagine the film being equally successful.</p> <p>The encouraging reaction has spurred interest from studios in making more black films. McQueen has announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/18/steve-mcqueen-to-make-film-about-paul-robeson\">his next project will be about the singer Paul Robeson</a>, the civil rights activist, singer and actor. Meanwhile, Coogler’s <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-followup-creed-building-cast-shoot-dates-eyed-20141111\">next film will be entitled Creed,</a> and is a spinoff of the Rocky films centering on the grandson of Apollo Creed, the black boxer whom Rocky beats to become champion. </p> <p>These filmmakers are making markedly different films than the projects Hollywood was interested in just 5 years ago. Only Lee Daniels’ Precious warranted any attention from the Oscars. That film received a great deal of criticism for telling a one-dimensional story of the black experience: poor, downtrodden and gratuitously hopeless. It’s a story that targets a specific audience. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/17/AR2009111703465.html?nav=rss_email/components&amp;sid=ST2009111703607\">Courtland Milloy criticized</a> the exaggerated story of black life portrayed in Precious: “When human pathology is given a black face, white people don’t have to feel so bad about their own.”</p> <p>Fast forward to 2014 and one of the year’s most significant releases is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/top-five-review-chris-rock-toronto-movie\">Chris Rock’s comedy Top Five</a>. The central theme of that film is the rejection of singular, dominant narratives. Chris Rock’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/17/chris-rock-the-top-five-moments-from-his-top-five-promo-tour\">promotion of the film</a>, has sparked interesting conversations about new realities of race and racism in the US. There is a great deal to dissect about race relations today, and grounding these films in the contemporary black experience stands in contrast to films that Hollywood usually hungers for.</p> <p>There was a serious lull in black films about contemporary experience, but with directors such as DuVernay, Simien, Coogler and McQueen, it seems we’ve entered a new and promising era where stories about blackness are told by artists who are as concerned with the storytelling as they are with how their work will resonate with those who have lived the black experience in America. That is no small thing.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"Selma’s release caps an interesting 18 months for black cinema, a period when filmmakers got back to to telling complex, honest and unflinching stories about life in America","headline":"2014: the year that black cinema bounced back in America","byline":"Elamin Abdelmahmoud","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ec5","wordcount":"865","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/24/1419432229274/34380444-bf4b-4078-af43-c0a0a6f607d5-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-28T13:00:12Z","standfirst":"<p>Selma’s release caps an interesting 18 months for black cinema, a period when filmmakers got back to telling complex, honest and unflinching stories about life in America</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/2014-the-year-that-black-cinema-bounced-back-in-america","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/25/2014-the-year-that-black-cinema-bounced-back-in-america","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/selma","webTitle":"Selma","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/selma","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/selma","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/12-years-a-slave","webTitle":"12 Years A Slave","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/12-years-a-slave","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/12-years-a-slave","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/fruitvale-station","webTitle":"Fruitvale Station","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fruitvale-station","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/fruitvale-station","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/martin-luther-king","webTitle":"Martin Luther King","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/martin-luther-king","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/oscars","webTitle":"Oscars","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/oscars","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/golden-globes","webTitle":"Golden Globes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/golden-globes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/golden-globes","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/top-five","webTitle":"Top Five","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/top-five","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/top-five","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/race","webTitle":"Race issues","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/race","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/race","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"profile/elamin-abdelmahmoud","webTitle":"Elamin Abdelmahmoud","r2ContributorId":"66761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414072350219/Elamin-Abdelmahmoud.jpg","firstName":"elamin","lastName":"abdelmahmoud","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Elamin Abdelmahmoud is a Canadian writer and journalist living in Toronto.

Too much Harry, too much Marv – and too much reconciling the sad truth that Kevin never ate that delicious-looking plate of macaroni and cheese he prayed to and in front of. (Which is just one of the reasons we know he grew up to be a criminal sociopath.) That’s why we’ve assembled this list of “holiday” movies you can bask in when you need to keep the traditional choices at bay.</p> <p>Sorry, Buzz and friends.</p> <h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/\">Die Hard</a> (1988)</h2> <p>It’s the Christmas movie in which Alan Rickman’s character doesn’t cheat on Emma Thompson. (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/16/how-we-made-love-actually\">Love Actually</a> – never forget.) Instead, Rickman plays a German terrorist named Hans Gruber who takes Bruce Willis (John McClane)’s wife hostage – along with others – at a Christmas party, making this soiree way worse than anything your company has ever thrown. The good news? Bruce Willis’ reputation as an action hero holds up. The better? <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/summer_movies/2007/06/yippeekiyay.html\">“Yippee ki yay, motherfucker.”</a></p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/prometheus\">Prometheus</a> (2012)</h2> <p>No matter what goes down at your family Christmas this year, remember it’s nowhere near as bad as what happens when a team of explorers land on an alien planet on Christmas day, and must subsequently defend the future of mankind as we know it. However, bonus points for a scene in which Idris Elba decorates a small tree alone on the ship. Charlie Brown would be proud.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/silver-linings-playbook\">Silver Linings Playbook</a> (2012)</h2> <p>True, Silver Linings Playbook takes place over the course of a few months, but the catalyst comes at Christmas, when Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) perform at a dance competition at a festively-decorated hotel. (And that’s all I’m going to tell you.)</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/edward-scissorhands-burton-fantasy\">Edward Scissorhands</a> (1990)</h2> <p>Look. Not to spoil a movie you’ve had 24 years to see, but on top of scenes filled with holiday imagery (lights, trees and tinsel), we learn that the reason it snows every Christmas is because Edward (Johnny Depp) once made snow – and an ice sculpture – for the woman he loved (Winona Ryder) to dance in, and kept doing it, even though they couldn’t be together. (No I’m not crying – you’re crying. Don’t look at me.)</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/10/3\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> (1999)</h2> <p>If you’re into traditional holiday films you’ve found the perfect reason not to watch this. Set at Christmas, Kubrick’s tale of marriage and (in)fidelity is accompanied by traditional trees and lights, creating a stark contrast between the beauty of the season and the movie’s dark halls, capes, masks and dead people. (The last scene will also change the way you see Christmas shopping, forever.)</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/08/my-guilty-pleasure-trading-places\">Trading Places </a>(1983)</h2> <p>But enough of the bleak: Trading Places delivers the hilarious cautionary tale of what happens when two greedy, evil bankers opt to ruin a stockbroker’s (Dan Aykroyd) life. Granted, the movie’s not entirely set at Christmas, but we get a scene where Akroyd eats salmon while wearing a Santa suit which, as far as I’m concerned, is the gift that keeps on giving.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433400/\">Just Friends</a> (2005)</h2> <p>Ryan Reynolds represents the best and worst of us as Chris Brander, a guy whose life was miserable in high school, and whose rejection at the hands of best pal Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart) “turned” him into a womanizer in his adult years. Alas, when he comes home for Christmas, disaster ensues – especially since most of us know that our hometowns will never allow us to escape who we once were.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/nov/13/markkermode\">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a> (2005)</h2> <p>Michelle Monaghan’s Christmas ensemble may be one of the only giveaways that this Robert Downey Jr/Val Kilmer vehicle is a holiday film, but that’s why we’re all here anyway, right? Enter: a hugely underrated film noir that sees a thief, actress, private eye and partridge in a pear tree (just kidding) forced to solve a murder-mystery. Just like the Christmas story taught us.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/23/why-i-love-movie-computers\">You’ve Got Mail </a>(1998)</h2> <p>Admittedly, You’ve Got Mail takes place from October to spring, but what matters most is that the movie’s most compelling scenes – when Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) discovers that Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is ShopGirl, when they have coffee, when Kathleen realizes she’s probably going to lose her store (and again, no, not crying) –occur over the Best Time of Year™. This is also the second time Nora Ephron busted out Christmas catalysts: in 1993’s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108160/\">Sleepless in Seattle</a>, Tom Hanks’ Sam Baldwin calls into the radio station for the first time on Christmas, just as Meg Ryan’s Annie Reed tunes in. And that’s why all other Christmas movies – and other movies in general – are garbage.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,558610,00.html\">Batman Returns</a> (1992)</h2> <p>Why does Batman Returns take place at Christmas? Easy: so Batman, Catwoman, the Penguin, and Max can fight under and using various decorations. Because the snow adds a little magic to the bleak Gotham cityscape. Because otherwise we wouldn’t know that mistletoe is poisonous. Also, because this was directed by Tim Burton, and by now we know that the only thing he loves more than Halloween is spooky Christmas. Way better than Bane’s shearling coat of The Dark Knight Rises. (Sorry, Christopher Nolan.) </p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"If you’ve had too much McAllister then there are plenty of other holiday movies to sink into with a glass of port in hand – and we don’t mean Love Actually","headline":"Bored by Home Alone?

– an off-kilter look at female soldiers in the IDF","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-12-05T16:32:19Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>If you show a staple gun in the first act it has to go off in the third. But that’s about the only dramatic principle to which the characters in Zero Motivation adhere. Normally that would be a problem, seeing as how this film is set in the army, but it’s not like we’re on the battle lines. Writer-director Talya Lavie drew from her own personal experience in the Israeli Defense Forces, setting her first feature in the dullest administrative office in a remote desert base. The elevator pitch “Girls meets M*A*S*H” may seem a tad reductive, but it’s apt. The angst is the same though the specifics, and urgency, has changed.</p> <p>The Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of Paper and Shredding, Daffi (Nelly Tagar), has devoted her life’s efforts toward one goal: to transfer her compulsory military service to a base in Tel Aviv. Visions of walking amid gleaming towers in high heels are the only thing keeping her alive. This potential abandonment causes some stress for her pal Zohar (Dana Ivgy), a coarse and slightly unkempt fellow secretary/soldier whose sole job, it would seem, is playing Minesweeper on an outdated computer. Zohar is a Yossarian-esque rascal, the only one who can see that everyone else at the base is nuts. If Daffi goes, Zohar will be left alone with the twin ditzes who sing pop songs and twirl their gum, a brusque Russian immigrant who makes fatalist remarks in a voice so low certain dogs couldn’t hear it and the by-the-book commander whose twin passions are paperwork and brown-nosing. It’s a textbook case of an individual mortified by dense authority. If Bill Murray were a twenty-something Israeli woman, he’d be Dana Igvy as the disheveled kibbutznik in Zero Motivation.</p> <p>The bulk of the film plays out in episodic form (indeed, it is segmented in three chapters) but this sitcom-like setup serves a purpose. Characters weave in and out. Someone that seems key will drift away as someone that seemed merely a gag takes center stage for a while. This approach works well to underscore the feeling of a life in which unseen and inexplicable forces are in control. In time, Zohar’s brusk exterior reveals an inner timidity beneath her khaki parka. She’s actually a virgin, likely the only one on the base, and if dating weren’t difficult enough these days try working that out as a new platoon of handsome paratroopers bunk down for just a few nights.</p> <p>The comedy in Zero Motivation ranges from wordplay to visual gags to some “saw that coming down Broadway” moments of comeuppance. There is, however, an undercurrent of sadness, particularly with Rama (Shani Klein) the group leader. Clearly she’s the foil – she keeps a framed photo of Margaret Thatcher on her wall – but it’s not her fault her battalion of paper filers are the Bad News Bears of the Israeli desert, and the way in which the male officers disregard her smacks of unspoken sexism. She’s passed over for a promotion for another woman, but are any men in her position asked to serve coffee?</p> <p>There are no references to Hamas or Palestinians or Arabs or anything else connoting the unending conflict in the Middle East. Yet our bumbling leads are reminded time and again that “we are at war” and “our soldiers are dying”. The only nod to headlines or history is a shot of a woman stapling up posters commemorating Israel’s numerous conflicts from 1948 through to our current decade. The degree to which real danger and bloodshed is ignored in Zero Motivation adds a strange urgency what could otherwise be an Office Space-like lark. When the movie does take some dark turns, it’s almost a relief.</p> <p>There are some whose politics have no room for a film like this. “This is not a laughing matter”, they’ll say. This attitude negates reality, and perhaps negates storytelling in general. Zero Motivation is a shot of honesty, in which short-term goals are far more important than larger geo-political ones. Perhaps because they are the only ones over which we have any control.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Writer-director Talya Lavie was inspired by her own time in the Israeli Defense Force and paints a picture of day-dreaming, gender politics and high heels","starRating":"4","headline":"Zero Motivation review – an off-kilter look at female soldiers in the IDF","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44vhx","wordcount":"682","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/5/1417794874505/e4dffb95-3be7-4ea5-ac10-adb077463610-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-08T11:30:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>Writer-director Talya Lavie was inspired by her own time in the Israeli Defense Force and paints a picture of day-dreaming, gender politics and high heels</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/05/zero-motivation-review-female-soldiers-idf","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/05/zero-motivation-review-female-soldiers-idf","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/israel","webTitle":"Israel","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/israel","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

But I had a great childhood in Ottawa, Canada.</p> <p><strong>James Brown showed me </strong>the responsibilities of being a band leader, with the rest of your group relying on you to keep the pay cheques coming in. Even if he was feeling down he didn’t let it affect his performance.</p> <p><strong>There is a universal life force that connects us all.</strong> I believe in an overhead cosmic godhead, a power that I draw on. But a church doesn’t have to be a church, it can just be one or more people in a room.</p> <p><strong>The death of John Belushi hit me hard. </strong>We had so much going on: a hit movie, a TV series. Suddenly I lost my partner. For a while afterwards I thought I might not come back from that.</p> <p><strong>Comedians today are more thoughtful than we were,</strong> and more grounded in real life. We did more absurdist stuff. But I love the younger guys – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jonah-hill\">Jonah Hill</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell\">Will Ferrell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy\">Melissa McCarthy</a>. The torch has been passed.</p> <p><strong>I think of myself as a capitalist-socialist. </strong>I’m not very political, but if you had to take my leanings I’m left of centre. After Hurricane Katrina a lot of money was sucked away and never went to the rural police departments. My charity [the <a href=\"http://bluelineusa.org/\">Blue Line Foundation</a>] provides equipment and training – if you provide a car or a vest, you are tangibly making a difference.</p> <p><strong>My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy. </strong>You get on that and you don’t need a shrink. When you’re on the bike all you’re doing is concentrating on staying alive. You get into the rhythm of the road and it’s quite zen.</p> <p><strong>I’m a big fan of the British monarchy.</strong> I am lucky to have met the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward – they’re a living link with history. I look at Prince William and see a young guy with his heart and soul in the right place.</p> <p><strong>I believe in the continuous consciousness of the soul: </strong>when you die it goes off on a journey and becomes something else. You can draw on the power of those who have gone before – they will inspire and help you.</p> <p><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/17/get-on-up-james-brown-chadwick-boseman\">Get On Up</a><em> is in cinemas now</em></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"The actor, 62, on being left of centre, having very mild Asperger’s, and passing the torch to younger comedians","headline":"Dan Aykroyd: ‘My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy.

The high level of discord, he suggests, has provided him with dramatic material ever since.</p> <p>Leigh, 71, tells Yentob that his father, Dr Abe Leigh, was deeply opposed to the idea that he might become an artist or an actor. He forbade him his frequent habit of sketching visitors to the house and regarded him as a problem child because of his creative interests.</p> <p>“I was always drawing caricatures of people and he asked me to stop because he thought it might offend them,” Leigh will say. “Even the word ‘artist’ was very frightening to him, anathema. So the idea that I would be any sort of artist was terrifying to him”</p> <p>At the age of 14 Leigh was taken to see an NHS psychiatrist. “He [his father] decided I had something wrong with me mentally. So I went to see this extremely nice guy. And these were the first adult conversations I had had with another adult.”</p> <p>The psychiatrist told Leigh’s father that there was no mental problem with his son, but the news was not welcomed. “He said, ‘There is nothing wrong with him. He just doesn’t like being at home.’ My father was very angry and stopped me going. So I used to go along on my own to see him, and when my father found out about that he threatened to have him struck off the register.”</p> <p>The film director also recalls that both his parents were concerned about social appearances and about doing “the done thing”. The family moved from a working-class area of Salford out into the suburbs and their desire to conform became the centre of conflict. “I remember life at home becoming a battlefield every night,” Leigh says. “There were rows about nothing really. And what Dr Leigh was really doing, of course, was giving me a lifetime’s ammunition for my film-making. But the screaming matches were awful, terrible, horrifying to remember.”</p> <p>When the teenage Leigh, who went on to win a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, showed an interest in acting, his father urged him to shake off his ambitions as “the moonings of a stagestruck girly”.</p> <p>After failing all but three of his O-level exams, Leigh went to London to study acting in the early 1960s. He later won the role of a deaf mute in an episode of the popular TV series <em>Maigret</em>, but then lost interest in performing.</p> <p>Leigh remembers his nascent interest in film-making first taking hold when he was a boy in Salford attending a funeral, a Jewish wake or shiva held at a family home. As he watched the coffin being carried downstairs and listened to a family argument die down, Leigh tells Yentob he suddenly thought it would make a great film. “It was already a tragi-comic scene, you see,” he says.</p> <p>In London the director eventually attracted funding for his first film from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/albert-finney\" title=\"link to Guardian profile site\">the actor/director Albert Finney</a>, who was then in his mid-30s. Finney decided to use his newfound wealth to fund three films: one by Stephen Frears, who made <em>Gumshoe,</em> starring Finney; another by Tony Scott, called <em>Loving Memory</em>; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/01/mike-leigh-on-bleak-moments\" title=\"link to Leigh on this film\">Leigh’s <em>Bleak Moments</em></a>, which was hailed by the late American film critic Roger Ebert as a masterpiece.</p> <p>In the <em>Imagine</em> documentary, Leigh talks through his early career in theatre and television, before he was finally able to attract funding to make a feature film again, 17 years later, still using his trademark improvisational techniques.</p> <p>Leigh has two sons with his former wife, the actress Alison Steadman, and, according to one of them, he may not have an entirely encouraging attitude to the arts himself. Interviewed in 2009, his son Leo Leigh, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/17/leo-leigh-swansea-love-story1\" title=\"link to Guardian interview\">also a film-maker</a>, jokingly revealed that his father had warned him away from acting “from junior school. My dad said: ‘If you become an actor, I’ll break your legs.’ ”</p> <p><em>Imagine will be screened on Tuesday 25 November at 10.35pm on BBC1

There he changed his name to Mohamed Husen and appeared in films alongside some of the country’s most famous actors, sometimes in movies that championed German imperialism, before ending up in a concentration camp for having an on-set interracial relationship.</p> <p>“I didn’t know much about Africans in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s,” says Knopf. “It seems like German people’s awareness of colonialism was washed away because of the second world war and the Holocaust. We lost our colonies after the first world war, so we felt we didn’t have to deal with them any more. Our history with them didn’t reach into the 1950s and 1960s like it did in many other European countries. So, the metaphor of the extra represents both the extras themselves and the absence of Africans from the German imagination.”</p> <p>Born in 1905, Husen volunteered, aged nine, for the Askari, elite native troops who helped Germany keep a tight grip on its dominions. “No one in Germany would expect that Kaiser Wilhelm had child soldiers,” reflects Knopf. “Some would carry weapons to the frontline. This was very dangerous anyway, but they couldn’t even use the weapons to defend themselves.”</p> <p>Husen’s father died during the first world war and he, too, was injured in service. Later, he got a job as a ship steward and sailed to Hamburg before heading to Berlin where, defiantly and unsuccessfully, he demanded back wages he claimed were owed to his family. He was instructed to leave the country, but the order wasn’t carefully administered and he stayed on without papers. He married a white actor, fathered a child by his mistress and eked out a living by working in costume at a cowboy-themed bar, at an Africa-themed circus and as a Swahili teacher at Berlin University’s Foreign Institute, where he primed civil servants for life in Africa.</p> <p>At this time, port and working-class communities in Hamburg and Berlin had significant black populations. The popularity of performers such as Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson offered migrants the chance to pretend to be from the US. Often they drifted between jobs in cabaret, dance and acting. Husen found blink-and-miss-them roles as a bellboy, a waiter and a saloon-bar lag, which, says Knopf, were two-dimensional. “He and other black performers were portrayed more or less as children.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04aba0fad913789f7671035c98990addd8b7e4e0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415897646928/835214dd-973f-4157-b88d-d72abe8d5455-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"majub statue\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A statue of Majub, whose story was pieced together by director Eva Knopf. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rainer Hoffmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet, for many German Africans, life on a film set was better than life outside. The studio was a safety zone, a place of make-believe rather than austere reality, a money-earning gig, a hub for gossip and friendship. According to Dorothea Diek, quoted in Robbie Aitken and Eve Rosenhaft’s study Black Germany (2013), “It was cheerful and cosy: no politics, no Nazis, just happy people. We were all together – young and old Africans.” On the set of Husen’s last film, German Africans were so aghast at the shivering, emaciated Togolese PoWs they performed alongside that they banded together to give them cigarettes and clothes.</p> <p>It was also on that set that Husen’s fortunes took a dramatic tumble. He was playing Ramazan, the loyal servant of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvV6DwsrY0\">Carl Peters</a> in Herbert Selpin’s 1941 biopic of the German explorer and Scramble for Africa conquistador. Peters was infamous for executing his black mistress after he discovered she was having an affair with his man-servant. Husen was denounced by an informant for his extramarital affair and sent, purportedly for his own safety, to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp\">Sachsenhausen</a>, where he died four years later.</p> <p>Other film-makers might have portrayed Husen as a pioneer or hero, a symbol of Germany’s far-from-glorious relationship with people of African descent. Knopf’s screenplay is spare and ruminative, as keen to point out how little is – and could be – known about him as it is to celebrate his life. “I don’t know if I liked him,” she says. “He wasn’t what the Nazis wanted him to be – a proper Askari. But nor was he what we would want him to be – an anti-colonial freedom fighter or an anti-fascist.” Indeed, by the mid-1930s, he was dressing up in military gear and appearing at rallies in front of banners bearing the slogan “Germany needs colonies”. “He went his own way. He doesn’t fit any clear-cut patterns of how we might think about history.”</p> <p>Some may think Husen a chump. What kind of fool would have travelled to a recent imperial giant hoping for social recognition or economic justice? “He took the Germans at their word,” suggests Knopf. “He was never meant to appear in Germany. He was just a fantasy, a story they told about themselves and about how faithful the Askari were and how much the Germans honoured them. You have to wonder: did he just not understand what he was doing?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://vimeo.com/77801442\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/77801442\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for Majub’s Journey, featuring footage of the actor from the era.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Husen’s life is rich in mystery. No diaries, correspondence or personal photographs appear to have survived. Knopf found a sheet of notepaper that he had personally designed, but it contained no writing. His name would not have been listed in credit sequences, and no trade magazines would have interviewed him; after all, as the film’s narrator comments, “extras are there only for the clothes they wear and the spot of moving colour that they bring to the screen.”</p> <p>His 12-year-old son, Heinz Bodo, supposedly collected his father’s ashes, but it seems likely that he died soon after during the bombing of Berlin.</p> <p>In a sense, Husen is a ghost, one who, like many immigrants from formerly colonised nations, is barely visible even upon arriving at the imperial centre. What non-filmic traces of him exist are down to his run-ins with the authorities – asking for help with rent, seeking compensation for military valour. Immersing herself in the archives, watching countless films from the period, trying to make out Husen in scenes captured on now-degraded stock, Knopf became a kind of surveillance operative. At the same time, she worried that bringing these forgotten images back into circulation would heap fresh humiliation on him.</p> <p>Yet, what makes Majub’s Journey so compelling is its artfully conveyed tension between the desire to liberate Husen from anonymity and the suspicion that his absence from the cinephilic record may be a blessing in disguise. “History is often written on the basis of what survives,” says Knopf. “But there are all these histories and tragedies and lost voices and souls that also shape the way our world is today. When you screen these films, you can make these ghosts appear again.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong>: A new film tells the unlikely

Ghostbusters reboot is official: who they gonna cast?","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-10-08T22:36:53Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>A new Ghostbusters film is on the way, and this time women will be doing most of the busting.<br /></p> <p>Director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat) confirmed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulfeig/status/519939618264088576\">on Twitter</a> Wednesday long-swirling rumors of a Ghostbusters reboot, and announced that Katie Dippold (Parks and Recreation, The Heat) is helping write it. “It’s official,” Feig wrote. “I’m making a new Ghostbusters &amp; writing it with<a href=\"https://twitter.com/katiedippold\"> @katiedippold</a> &amp; yes, it will star hilarious women. That’s who I’m gonna call.”</p> <p>The original Ghostbusters movie is like a lot of other films: the story of a group of men whose technological innovation, devil-may-care attitude and entrepreneurial spirit lead them to take advantage of an unexpected spike in demand. It’s just that their particular good fortune was a paranormal invasion of New York City.</p> <p>But it was a huge hit, making more at the box office than anything else in 1984 but Beverly Hills Cop (<a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1984&amp;p=.htm\">and that includes</a> Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). </p> <p>The new movie will not be a sequel so much as a “total reboot”, Variety <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/paul-feig-ghostbusters-comedy-reboot-1201274332/\">has reported</a>. Ivan Reitman, who directed the original movie and Ghostbusters II, dropped out of directing a third movie in the series in March, the report said.</p> <p>It’s not that there were no hilarious women in the original movie, which was written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and starred the writers plus Bill Murray. In Ghostbusters, Sigourney Weaver plays a New Yorker whose apartment in <a href=\"http://www.bigwaste.com/photos/ny/ghostbusters/barrett.shtml\">55 Central Park West</a> becomes haunted. So she commutes to <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hook-and-ladder-8-ghostbusters-new-york\">Hook &amp; Ladder 8</a> in Tribeca, where the Ghostbusters have set up their headquarters. Before the movie is over she delivers witty ripostes to Murray’s jokes, levitates over a bed and makes love to Rick Moranis. (Weaver has announced her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/09/ghostbusters-3-sigourney-weaver-son\">son would appear</a> in the third film.)</p> <p>There should be ample opportunity for the writers of the new movie to riff on the original, which used sex as a metaphor for the ghost apocalypse, with Weaver playing the “gatekeeper”, Moranis playing the “keymaster” and their unearthly offspring embodied by a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=slavitza+jovan&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1418&amp;bih=1038&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IKg1VPztL5Dd7Qb_v4DYDg&amp;ved=0CCAQsAQ\">Serbian supermodel</a>. </p> <p>One thing they’ll have a hard time beating: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc\">that theme song</a>.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"Bridesmaids’ Paul Feig announces he will direct and co-write reboot about women of paranormal pest extermination team","headline":"Women-led Ghostbusters reboot is official: who they gonna cast?","byline":"Tom McCarthy in New York","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/42a5x","wordcount":"352","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412804742672/90a36f67-0b04-46dd-bd66-991f0799fabd-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-11T22:36:53Z","standfirst":"<p>Bridesmaids’ Paul Feig announces he will direct and co-write reboot about women of paranormal pest extermination team</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/08/new-ghostbusters-paul-feig-women-reboot-stars","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/oct/08/new-ghostbusters-paul-feig-women-reboot-stars","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/ghostbusters","webTitle":"Ghostbusters","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/ghostbusters","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tommccarthy","webTitle":"Tom McCarthy","r2ContributorId":"49576","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/24/1382626910884/tom-mccarthy.jpg","firstName":"tom","lastName":"mccarthy","twitterHandle":"TeeMcSee","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom McCarthy is national affairs correspondent for Guardian US.

The Messenger: the Gary Webb story has holes but Renner's performance still sticks – review","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2014-09-26T17:28:26Z","fields":{"liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>He has a sturdy build, a clear moral compass, wears cool sunglasses and rides a vintage motorcycle. Everything about Jeremy Renner’s portrayal of journalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb\">Gary Webb</a> in Kill the Messenger readies a conditioned moviegoer to expect him to kick ass in the name of justice. But this is a movie for grownups, so <a href=\"http://www.blastr.com/2013-5-16/rumor-day-jeremy-renner%E2%80%99s-being-replaced-hawkeye-avengers-2\">The Avengers’ Hawkeye</a> puts down the bow and arrow and picks up his pen – or more specifically his mid-90s desktop mouse – and uses his brain instead of his brawn. </p> <p>Webb was the relatively small potatoes reporter at the San Jose Mercury News whose fearlessness and determination helped him break an amazing story, and Renner gives this role everything he’s got.</p> <p>As a middle schooler in the 80s, I befriended some older kids who read ‘zines and listened to the Clash and wore jackets with tiny pins on them like Rick from the Young Ones. One such pin read CIA: Cocaine Import Agency. Even suburban twerps from New Jersey suspected that the government was pumping crack into the inner cities and using the cash to fund anti-communist Nicaraguan militias. There was never any proof of this – at least not then, but a decade later Gary Webb connected many of the dots in a series of articles that, at first, had him hailed as the next Woodward and Bernstein, but that’s only the first half of the story. The second part, and, frankly, the more interesting part, shows how forces conspired to bury the story. </p> <p>“Some stories are too true to tell,” warns Michael Sheen as the DC insider beside a reflecting pool – where all movies are forced by law to shoot the scene where a DC insider warns reporters they are in too deep. But Webb won’t be waved away. Not because he has an anti-government radical agenda, but because he’s still naïve enough to think that a journalist owes his first duty to the truth. </p> <p>After the initial splash of success comes the backlash. The CIA refutes every claim (naturally) and even do a little psy-ops on him. But the CIA doesn’t have to destroy Webb when his so-called colleagues are there to do the job. </p> <p>Bigger papers like the Washington Post are humiliated that they got scooped by a pipsqueak outlet like the San Jose Mercury News, and with the aid of the CIA’s mouthpiece they commence with the policy of CYA (Cover Your Ass). By tearing Webb’s story apart (and, by extension, Webb himself) the mainstream press can sweep all this under the rug.</p> <p>It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes. Yet the film in total – if I may paraphrase Webb’s critics – has a number of holes. Its use of newsy exposition montage is deplorable (the pre-title sequence is exhausting) and a number of characters just drop in to shove the plot along to its next checkpoint.</p> <p>Much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game than drama. Director Michael Cuesta (best known for helming cable shows like Homeland and Dexter) makes a few choices that aren’t exactly what you’d call subtle. He’s got Barry Pepper as the sleazy government operative and Michael Kenneth Williams as the drug dealer primed with bon mots. And when Webb sits down to actually bang out his report he cranks The Clash’s “Know Your Rights.” (Those pin-wearing chums from school would be proud.) When Webb gives a rousing speech endorsing truth, justice and the American way at the film’s conclusion, he’s at a banquet and the light off the back curtain frames him with a golden halo.</p> <p>And yet what Renner’s selling still sticks, because he’s just that sympathetic (and, of course, on the right side of the issues.) I remember when the Webb story broke and then I also remember people shoo-ing it away. What I didn’t remember was the aftermath. I won’t spoil too much of that here, but <em>why</em> I don’t remember it is clear: when evidence supporting Webb’s claim came to light, it had the misfortune of surfacing when the American media had its eyes exclusively on Bill Clinton’s zipper.</p> <p>Kill the Messenger (like Webb) is clear about the line between fact and conjecture – but the facts alone make this an “issue film” worth seeing.<br /></p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes, but much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game","starRating":"3","headline":"Kill The Messenger: the Gary Webb story has holes but Renner's performance still sticks – review","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","commentable":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/42vdc","wordcount":"713","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/26/1411750078616/8bdc8a15-6d88-4ea2-a320-4447cfb21e1f-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-29T17:28:36Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes, but much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/26/kill-the-messenger-gary-webb-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/sep/26/kill-the-messenger-gary-webb-review","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.
