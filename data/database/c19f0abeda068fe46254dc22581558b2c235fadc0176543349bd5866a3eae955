Closes do better in Scotland, and roads are the most expensive, relatively speaking, in Northern Ireland.</p> <p><strong>This is a load of old boulevards. Do you think any of the millions of people trying to get a home, any sort of home, in Britain care about this? Lanes, ways, crescents, avenues ... they’re desperate to live anywhere.

It’s August.</p> <p><strong>Splendid. Now tell me what it is.</strong> An unspecified number of people at airports are refusing to show their boarding passes in duty free shops when asked.</p> <p><strong>I thought we all had to? Isn’t it for security? Or how they can tell you’re a traveller and thus entitled to duty free?</strong> No! That’s what everybody thinks but it isn’t true! The whole thing is a great big late-capitalist lie!</p> <p><strong>All right, calm down. What is the truth then? </strong>The truth is that these so-called “duty-free shops” don’t have to pay VAT on sales to people leaving the EU, so they ask to see people’s boarding passes in order to establish which purchases are eligible.</p> <p><strong>Sounds good. The shop pays less tax, I pay less money.</strong> Ah, but do you? A lot of shops just charge the same price and pocket the savings. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/retailers-told-to-come-clean-after-being-accused-of-pocketing-millions-from-vat-discounts-on-airport-dutyfree-sales-10446111.html\" title=\"\">The Independent singles out Boots, WH Smith and Dixons</a> among the offenders.</p> <p><strong>But this is naked brigandry!</strong> Some people take that view. For their part, the shops insist that they pass the saving on evenly throughout their stores, that their stuff is still cheap by high street standards, and anyway offering different prices to different customers is a faff. Or as WH Smith put it, a “practical impossibility”.</p> <p><strong>Yeah right. I bet a lot of people feel misled anyway. </strong>Probably. “Dozens of readers have come forward to say they will refuse to show their boarding cards in future,” <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/air-travellers-refusing-to-show-boarding-passes-at-airport-shops-after-news-that-the-information-is-used-by-stores-to-avoid-paying-vat-10449107.html\" title=\"\">the Independent reports</a>.</p> <p><strong>That sounds rather vague.</strong> OK, well, the Telegraph has conducted <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11796026/VAT-revolt-as-thousands-refuse-to-show-boarding-passes-to-airport-shops.html\" title=\"\">its own reader poll</a>, in which 85% of people said that they will no longer show their boarding passes either.</p> <p><strong>Ha! That’ll bring the fat cats to their knees! How have they responded? </strong>They’ve said it’s fine. “Any of our customers that do not wish to share this information can shop with us without the boarding card being scanned”, said Boots.</p> <p><strong>Oh. </strong>Indeed.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “You’d like to see my boarding pass? Certainly …”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“…JUST PRISE IT FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10669793","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2352536","internalContentCode":"457707079","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Many air travellers at UK airports think they have to show their boarding passes when asked for them in shops.

It was created by the big bang and is therefore 13.82bn years old. </strong>Oh. Well, anyway, I’m talking about the time in North Korea.</p> <p><strong>As a concept or a measuring system? </strong>Erm, the second one, I think. North Korea has announced that on Saturday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/north-korea-to-turn-clocks-back-by-30-minutes-to-establish-own-time-zone\" title=\"\">the whole country will move its clocks back half an hour</a>, making the time in North Korea GMT+8.5 instead of GMT+9.</p> <p><strong>How can you just declare that the time is different? </strong>It’s easy really. You just make a law that everyone has to pretend the time is different, then after a while they forget they’re pretending, like in France.</p> <p><strong>I love the half hour especially. Those crazy North Koreans! </strong>It’s not as crazy as you might think. Central Australia, Venezuela and much of South Asia operate on half-hour time zones. The whole of India is on GMT+5.5, even though it’s more or less an hour and a half wide.</p> <p><strong>What? </strong>And Nepal is the wackiest of the lot. There, it is GMT+5.45, making the county 15 minutes ahead of India.</p> <p><strong>Oooh! Get Nepal! </strong>In Western Australia, there are a few places, including a small town called Eucla, that operate at GMT+8.45, basically because nobody can stop them.</p> <p><strong>They’re just trying to be different. </strong>That may well be the case.</p> <p><strong>So, why are North Korea doing it?</strong> “The wicked Japanese imperialists committed such unpardonable crimes as depriving Korea of even its standard time while mercilessly trampling down its land with 5,000-year-long history and culture and pursuing the unheard-of policy of obliterating the Korean nation,” said the North Korean Central News Agency. The new time will be different from South Korea’s and Japan’s.</p> <p><strong>Trying to be different again? </strong>Yes. It was kind of the same story when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/10/venezuela.rorycarroll\" title=\"\">Hugo Chavez changed Venezuela’s time to GMT-4.5 in 2007</a>. He claimed to be giving schoolchildren more sunlight in the morning, but he also happened to be giving the country a different time zone to anywhere in the US.</p> <p><strong>So, it’s kind of a Marxist hipster thing? </strong>I guess so. Although I doubt there are many of those in central Australia.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “What time is it?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “About 1950.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10659321","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-10T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2350860","internalContentCode":"457687500","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"North Korea is changing its official time zone, turning the clocks back by 30 minutes.

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> As bad as Ebola, climate change and Aids combined reckons Noel Edmonds, but worse because it’s invisible, or something.</p> <p><strong>Or something? That doesn’t sound very authoritative.</strong> Well, you try summing up the greatest single threat facing mankind in a pithy sentence.</p> <p><strong>Listen, I don’t even know what electrosmog is, but I’m pretty sure it isn’t the greatest threat facing mankind.</strong> It is.</p> <p><strong>Who says?</strong> I told you: Noel Edmonds.</p> <p><strong>Noel Edmonds?</strong> In an <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/noel-edmonds-death-doesnt-exist-6194153\">interview with the Daily Mirror</a>, Edmonds claimed that electrosmog – clouds of electromagnetic fields caused by Wi-Fi, phone signals and electricity – is endangering humanity. It’s making us electrosensitive, and systematically destroying our own natural electromagnetic fields.</p> <p><strong>And that’s a bad thing because?</strong> “All you are is energy, remember that.” There, a direct Edmonds quote. </p> <p><strong>Interesting. Got any more?</strong> He also said: “There isn’t such a thing as death, it’s just departure. You cannot die. It’s been known for a very long time.”</p> <p><strong>Riiiiiiiight. </strong>No, it’s worth listening to. Edmonds is an expert at this stuff. Remember when <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/alternative-medicine/3338065/Need-a-lover-or-a-house-Call-on-the-cosmos.html\">he discovered cosmic ordering</a> almost a decade ago? He sent a message out to the universe and, as a result, <a href=\"http://www.religionnewsblog.com/14246/dear-cosmos-can-i-have-a-hit-show\">his career was instantly rehabilitated</a>.</p> <p><strong>Yes, he got to present a ridiculous quasi-superstitious </strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/21/broadcasting.arts\">daytime quiz show</a></strong><strong> where contestants are financially rewarded by actively denying the concept of coincidence.</strong> Look, it’s a job.</p> <p><strong>Anyway, how worried should I be about electrosmog? </strong>Really worried. Oh, sure, 10 years ago the World Health Organisation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jan/18/guardianweeklytechnologysection4\">denied that electromagnetic fields had any negative effect</a> on humans, stating: “There is no scientific basis to link ES [electrosensitive] symptoms to EMF exposure.” But then it would say that, wouldn’t it?</p> <p><strong>Would it?</strong> Of course it would. This is a huge conspiracy. A huge global conspiracy, and all the corporations are in on it. They want to enslave us all with magnets. Edmonds is right. He’s like our Jesus.</p> <p><strong>Which makes Mr Blobby?</strong> I dunno, Moses or something.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Let’s stop the scourge of electrosmog by banning Wi-Fi.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Let’s also stop it by unplugging our TVs whenever we see Noel Edmonds.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10650803","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-06T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2349326","internalContentCode":"457667842","publication":"The

decades.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Legions of shivering victims, huddled in corners with shawls on.</p> <p><strong>Who is this war between? </strong>Men and women. In offices.</p> <p><strong>Ah. And what’s it about? The pay gap? Sexual harassment? Statutory maternity leave? The glass ceiling?</strong> The air conditioning.</p> <p><strong>The air conditioning?</strong> The women are cold. The men not so much.</p> <p><strong>So it’s not a real war. </strong>The problem is real enough, according to <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2741.epdf?referrer_access_token=pXpePW-odS-mlDXVXL43LtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OxYB2QX8K1vS0r2SpOOxl5-QKWpBFSROwh6pmh1aKkmPT41eJ7jFgHQP7XO5ue9xkEyGglxqnWoGKn57Qouc1b15WRUGpzRlRjRCkWqii68TGKS0rnizQDKiiwTbJ9YEFuB_VjzVjI7bDdZbZU4wCiGijw8e1YdgZJFblCEbI8LpidPFdwvlpdMVKUsN7ruqc3aclfYR4MOVWHUNrDaqRX&amp;tracking_referrer=www.nytimes.com\">a study published in Nature Climate Change</a>: women are suited to an average office temperature about 3C warmer than men.</p> <p><strong>Someone did a study of that? </strong>Yes. Professor Boris Kingma of Maastricht University studied 16 women performing “light office work”.</p> <p><strong>Sounds as if the professor needs to keep his eyes on his computer, before someone complains to HR. </strong>He was studying them in a climate chamber. For science.</p> <p><strong>What were his findings? </strong>He found that women had a significantly lower metabolic rate than men. Men are comfortable – neither sweating nor shivering – at about 22C. Women, on the other hand, find that a bit chilly.</p> <p><strong>What’s the problem? Turn the dial down a notch. </strong>The problem is that climate control in office buildings is based on a comfort standard first set in the 1960s, which was in turn based on the metabolic rate of a 40-year old, 70kg man.</p> <p><strong>That’s so sexist. </strong>Sexist, and wasteful. Offices have been kept cooler than they need to be for years because we’ve failed to take into account the actual metabolic values of a huge chunk of the workforce.</p> <p><strong>Are there any other advantages to making the men sweat a little? </strong>Yes. Another <a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2004/10/warm-offices-linked-fewer-typing-errors-higher-productivity\">study from 2004</a> found that people working in warmer conditions – 25C, as opposed to 22C – make fewer typing mistakes and have increased productivity.</p> <p><strong>25C it is, then. </strong>Fine, as long as you’re aware that means more men wearing shorts in the office during summer.</p> <p><strong>Hmm. On balance, I think it might be better to put a box of free pashminas near the lifts. </strong>Put it in an email, and we can raise it at the next meeting.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Let’s work together to reduce gender-discriminating bias in thermal comfort predictions.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Sorry about all the mistakes. It’s hard to type with these mittens on.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10648079","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-05T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2348839","internalContentCode":"457661362","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"A study has determined that women who work in offices feel the cold – because the air conditioning is controlled by men.

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 206 years</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Varied. There are about 115,500 letter boxes in use in the UK, in at least 800 subtly different styles, some circular, some oval, some square or rectangular, some hexagonal. The classic pillar box, first installed in Jersey in 1852, is now most often seen in busy urban areas. The wall box is smaller, and can be fitted flush into a wall, or attached to a pole, most often in rural locations. Most are cast iron. At least 98% of the population lives within half a mile of one. Each has the “cipher” of the reigning monarch when they were installed.</p> <p><strong>Blimey. You know </strong><a href=\"http://www.royalmailgroup.com/sites/default/files/Royal%20Mail%20Post%20Boxes%20Heritage%20Agreement.pdf\"><strong>a lot about post boxes</strong></a><strong>. </strong>“Letter boxes” please! And my knowledge is nothing in comparison to the members of the <a href=\"http://www.lbsg.org\">Letter Box Study Group</a>, the recognised authority on such matters.</p> <p><strong>I had no idea the things were so admired.</strong> Oh, yes. In fact, people love them so much they’re stealing them. <a href=\"http://www.wattonandswaffhamtimes.co.uk/news/four_royal_mail_post_boxes_stolen_from_villages_in_south_west_norfolk_1_3927183\">Four went in Norfolk in January</a>. In April, <a href=\"http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/post-box-stolen-after-thieves-9645073\">four more went in Stockton</a>. About 100 are stolen every year.</p> <p><strong>How on earth do you steal a letter box?</strong> They’re often buried, bolted or concreted in place, and some weigh nearly half a ton, so I agree it isn’t easy. But where’s there’s a market paying £5,000 on eBay, there’s a way.</p> <p><strong>If they end up on eBay, doesn’t it make them easy to find? </strong>Not necessarily. The boxes may change hands a few times first, and don’t have serial numbers or anything, so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/02/royal-mail-sees-red-over-spate-of-post-box-thefts\">Royal Mail are now planning to fit some with electronic tags or metal-marking technology</a>. There are quite a few legitimately owned ones, too, as the authorities used to sell decommissioned boxes, but in 2003 they started reusing them instead, which may have pushed the price up.</p> <p><strong>Well, I never.</strong> Decommissioned letter boxes that can’t be moved have to be painted black and have their slots sealed. Some are actually listed.</p> <p><strong>Fascinating. Why do people want the things?</strong> To look eccentric, mostly. They might put one in their garden to receive post, or perhaps just to look pretty.</p> <p><strong>But now they just make you look like an eccentric thief? </strong>I suppose they do.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Where did you get that lovely letter box?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Ah yes, there’s a funny story attached to that. Some criminals I met on the internet ripped it out of a wall in Stockton with a hammer drill and a Transit van.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10645087","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-04T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2348069","internalContentCode":"457651844","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Royal Mail is taking evasive action to foil the 100 post box thefts that take place every year.

Source: Tesco PLC</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Oh God. It’s Britain’s national cliche.</strong> Don’t be so mean. For six years, <a href=\"http://www.voiceovers.co.uk/helena.breck\">Breck’s voice</a> has charmed shoppers at the automatic tills at Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Marks &amp; Spencer with its bright yet classy explanations of how to do very basic things we’ve all done hundreds of times before and are probably redundant anyway because the machine isn’t working, but which we’re forced to listen to over and over again while we wait for a member of staff with a gilet and a key to please, God, make it go away.</p> <p><strong>That’s kind of what I meant.</strong> Anyway, now Tesco has made her go away.</p> <p><strong>How come?</strong> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/epic/tsco/11772689/Tesco-replaces-irritating-unexpected-item-in-the-bagging-area-self-checkout-voice-with-male-recording.html\">They’ve replaced her</a> with a slightly more laconic man.</p> <p><strong>Which old soap operas was he in?</strong> I’ll have to get back to you on that.</p> <p><strong>Didn’t the machines’ American manufacturer, NCR, say that it had researched the subject and found that customers </strong><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/10950089/Woman-behind-unexpected-item-in-bagging-area-message-revealed.html\"><strong>overwhelmingly responded better to the female voice</strong></a><strong>?</strong> Why, yes, it did. Maybe that was before people had heard the voice 60,000 times.</p> <p><strong>So, what is this new man like?</strong> Oh, you know: resonant, posh-ish, improbably excited by the minutiae of shopping. Instead of Breck’s rather cold way of saying, “Notes are dispensed below the scanner,” he gives us a chummy, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI1Lr08LDps\">“Don’t forget your change, especially notes!”</a></p> <p><strong>He has a point. No one wants to forget those lovely notes.</strong> No, indeed. Or to be repeatedly told about it.</p> <p><strong>Still, I don’t see how anyone could match the quality of Breck’s “Beep!” when the barcode hits the laser.</strong> I don’t think that was her.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Please take your items.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Please unplug yourself.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10637632","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-03T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2347074","internalContentCode":"457638399","publication":"The

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Eek … yawn … yikes … eurgh … aaah!</p> <p><strong>That’s very evocative, thanks. Almost like witnessing a real birth. </strong>Oh, have you attended one before?</p> <p><strong>Only my own. </strong>That doesn’t really count. Most babies are too busy nearly dying to appreciate the magic of childbirth.</p> <p><strong>So tell me, what is it actually like?</strong> Like a surprise birthday party in an abattoir.</p> <p><strong>I’ve never been to one of those. </strong>Well, it is difficult to describe. You kind of need to be there. Luckily, younger women are growing increasingly keen on inviting lots of people to witness the occasion, if <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11766317/crowd-birthing-mums-social-media.html\" title=\"\">a survey by the vlogging website Channel Mum</a> is to be believed.</p> <p><strong>Is it?</strong> Probably not. But still, the results are quite dramatic. A total of 2,000 mothers took part in the survey, and among the teenagers and twentysomethings, an average of eight additional people were said to have attended the birth.</p> <p><strong>Say that again.</strong> An average of eight people were there watching, besides the mother and the medical staff. Most often the woman’s partner, her mother and the mother-in-law.</p> <p><strong>Yeah, plus five others. And who the hell are they? Your sister, your neighbour, two BFFs and Des from work?</strong> Could be. And that’s on average, remember, which suggests it is sometimes more than eight. I agree it sounds unlikely, but you can’t argue with data collected unscientifically to publicise a website.</p> <p><strong>Oh, can’t I now?</strong> Anyway, Channel Mum’s founder is a woman called Siobhan Freegard OBE.</p> <p><strong>And what does Freegard OBE have to say about it?</strong> “The younger generation are used to sharing every aspect of their lives, so why not birth?”</p> <p><strong>Because it’s inconvenient, unhygienic, narcissistic, revolting and takes forever.</strong> You sourpuss. “The crowdbirthing phenomenon may not suit everyone,” says Freegard, “but being part of the birth is an honour and privilege which unites friends and family like nothing else.”</p> <p><strong>Oh really? In that case, maybe they would be honoured to attend the next four years of defecation and screaming? </strong>Yeah, they’re not so keen on that.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Now that’s what I call an operating theatre.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Oi! Which one of you lot finished all the pethidine?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10627186","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-07-29T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2345022","internalContentCode":"457607750","publication":"The

The first book was published in 1970. The TV series came eight years later.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Souped-up. Refitted. Buffed to a high shine. Made over. Smoothed, glossed, planed and varnished. Altogether Americanised. Potentially.</p> <p><strong>A glamorous Darrowby? Are you sure? </strong>Well, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/27/hbo-all-creatures-great-and-small-remake-bbc\" title=\"\">rumours are rife</a> that HBO – home of Sex and the City, Game of Thrones, The Wire and Trues Blood and Detective – has picked up the rights to the BBC drama and wants to give it a big-budget remake.</p> <p><strong>Umm … I’m going to need a moment.</strong> By all means, my friend, take it. I understand.</p> <p><strong>We’re talking about the one in the 80s? The gentle adventures of Christopher Timothy as James Herriot, the 1950s rural Yorkshire vet? </strong>Yes, that’s the one. Robert Hardy – a ham so rare it can’t be cured – as his cantankerous boss Siegfried, Carol Drinkwater then Lynda Bellingham as his lovely wife and Peter Davison as Siegfried’s younger brother Tristan. The very same.</p> <p><strong>So, what’s gone on with the world that this has come to pass? </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/12/doctor-who-bbc-worldwide\" title=\"\">Doctor Who</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/16/uk-period-drama-scores-emmy-nominee-success-with-downton-and-wolf-hall\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3139959/It-s-Smouldark-BBC-drama-premieres-sparks-outpouring-lustful-tweets-aimed-star-Aidan-Turner.html\" title=\"\">Poldark</a>, basically.

Doctor Who with absolutely nothing resembling any bit of anything about Doctor Who, except for Peter Davison, who isn’t remotely the Doctor Who you know and love?</p> <p><strong>Any word on who’s in the casting frame? </strong>Pure speculation at this point. But who wouldn’t love to see Chris Noth as Siegfried, Matthew McConaughey as James Herriot and Lena Headey as Mrs H? And the postwar Yorkshire Dales as a microfarm in the Obamas’ vegetable garden? And Nicholas Cage as the sheepdog being put down every other episode? Who wouldn’t? <em>Who wouldn’t?</em></p> <p><strong>How are they going to find anyone method enough to put his arm up a cow’s bum 18 times a series? </strong>Christian Bale for the arm, Dustin Hoffman for the bum. Sorted.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> This’ll play in Peoria.</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> Maybe the Brontës can come visit! SJP as Charlotte, Kim Cattrall as Emily and Cynthia Nixon as Anne!
