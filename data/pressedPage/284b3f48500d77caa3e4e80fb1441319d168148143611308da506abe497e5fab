I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p><p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, 'That's a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.' Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p><p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p><p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: 'What's that?' 'Just hold it in your hand,' I said, 'and all the journalists next week will be saying you've got the whole world in your hand.' And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p><p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p><p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p><p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p><p>Adamski goes to number one with 'Killer' on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p><p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p><p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during 'Like a Virgin' on her 'Blond Ambition' tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p><p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p><p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon's offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads 'Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick', in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-27T08:55:48Z","standfirst":"The Stone Roses' tour manager Steve Adge recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes<br

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-27T15:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<strong>Electric Ballroom, London</strong><br />The feminist punk legend makes a long-awaited return to the UK with her stage banter intact and a set of songs that make you want to trampoline","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/499by","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432734676066/The-Julie-Ruin.-001.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"456925817","starRating":"4","byline":"Maddy Costa","internalPageCode":"2309790","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-06-27T14:45:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/punk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Punk","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/punk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/punk","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"tone/livereview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/livereview","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maddycosta","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Maddy Costa","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/maddycosta","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/maddycosta","references":[],"firstName":"","lastName":"costa"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/reviews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"ca9fc971db9af6653ab5cc76d48202de785474dd","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432734681451/The-Julie-Ruin.-005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432734681451/The-Julie-Ruin.-005.jpg","source":"Jim Bennett/Corbis","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"The Julie Ruin.","suppliersReference":"51417580","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Jim Bennett/Corbis","caption":"‘Exquisitely argue the need for accessible feminism’ … the Julie Ruin.

His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-01T18:21:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

The first is ridiculous: to jealously hoard her as my private heroine, my precious personal discovery. And the second is quite the opposite: to speculatively, hopefully drop her name to anyone I suspect might share this feeling, anticipating that ignition of kinship that happens when the name lands. This may be what a cult hero is: the person you both want to tell no one and everyone about.</p><p>She does not, of course, have an audience of one. When I Googled her for this piece, I found an interview with Kim Gordon in which the former Sonic Youth guitarist and bassist drops Ribeiro’s name with characteristic casualness. “I like this Portuguese singer, Catherine Ribeiro. She’s pretty great. She’s Portuguese, though she sang in French.” My hoarder half was dismayed (“Now everyone will know! Thanks a LOT Kim”) and then my other half felt vain, self-congratulatory gratification (“a co-sign from Kim Gordon! What excellent taste I have!”).<br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T11:39:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\">The prog-rock sorceress’s work with Alpes has

The genre grew from speedy, repetitive ghetto house in the late 1990s and early 2000s, yet it also borrows from drum’n’bass with its double-time clave triplets, syncopated toms and huge sub-bass.<br /></p><p> RP Boo (aka 43-year-old Kavain Space) is credited as footwork’s pioneer. In April, Planet Mu released Classics Vol 1, a compilation including many of Boo’s earliest recordings, including Baby Come On from 1997. Hot on its heels comes Fingers, Bank Pads &amp; Shoe Prints, which mixes his nascent footwork with new material. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T13:53:32.057+01:00","standfirst":"<p>After the sudden death of footwork’s most prominent artist – DJ Rashad – last year, the genre had to take stock.

But one thing you almost never see is a performer using a torrential downpour of rain to their advantage, which is one of the things that makes <strong>Mary J Blige</strong>’s Friday afternoon appearance on the Pyramid stage a genuinely remarkable event. She announces that she’s never been to Glastonbury before – handy clarification for anyone who thought they saw the self-styled Queen of Hip-Hop Soul down the front for Ozric Tentacles in 93 – but her performance is dazzlingly slick. Then she plays a startlingly intense version of the title track of her 2001 album No More Drama, crouching on the rain-lashed lip of the stage, as if she’s treating the elements as a special effect, amping up the song’s harrowing, cathartic power. Her voice is incredible, all the more so if you’ve spent the earlier part of the afternoon listening to some pretty wan-sounding alt-rock bands. When it ends, the audience goes so nuts for so long that her band can’t start the next song. Looking out over the field, Blige bursts into tears.</p><figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dde0a2a9432df12eeed34ee9fb85c51303e5f1b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508437217/f5519297-e292-4dd1-8bd1-a536aa07aff3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Redferns via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-29T16:25:54.642+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\">Florence Welch pulled out all the stops, while Kanye’s set was faltering and relatively restrained.

It’s exactly the type of smooth sentimentality and silliness that a Sunday afternoon audience at Glastonbury deserves: from the gloriously gooey Penny Lover, to the chintzy You are my Destiny and the funk triumph of Brick House, Richie, dressed in a black blazer adorned with a glittered trim, packs every single second of the show with unbridled pop theatrics.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"437693b62f802656a124047e5f1b044eb10db847\"> \n   <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/437693b62f802656a124047e5f1b044eb10db847/0_0_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Richie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is it tea you’re looking for?</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Most vital to the Alabama-born singer’s Glastonbury debut is his knowing relationship with his audience, many of whom are wearing masks and T-shirts emblazoned with drawings of his face. Well aware of his camp charisma, he wins support from the crowd immediately, complimenting their ability to remember his lyrics, whipping them into a yobbish singalong for Three Times a Lady, and triggering some bolshie dance moves during Dancing on the Ceiling. The opening to the Commodores’ Easy even prompts a sigh of joy from the crowd. In contrast to Kanye’s cold, brutalist headline set the night before, Richie provides a reassuring hour of tender, tacky hits; mud melts into milk chocolate, the grey clouds are silky silver pillows, joy is restored. </p> \n  <p>Before capping off his set with All Night Long, he necks a glass of what looks like vodka cranberry, and thousands of fans and converts cheer and laugh. Lionel Richie: party starter, people pleaser, a Glastonbury highlight.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Lionel Richie\"> \n   <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; .title { display:block;} .face { width: 80px; height: 80px; margin: 0 -5px;} &lt;/style&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;title&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/ratinglabel.598b8588.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-28T18:06:51.009+01:00\">at 6.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T10:54:35.285+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\">Did the sun come back for a brief Sunday moment?

Ribeiro threatens dark magic, even as she teeters at the brink of epic","body":"<p>Listening to Catherine Ribeiro, a little-known prog-rock sorceress who released a slew of impeccable records in France in the 1970s with her band Alpes, I’m split between two adolescent impulses. The first is ridiculous: to jealously hoard her as my private heroine, my precious personal discovery. And the second is quite the opposite: to speculatively, hopefully drop her name to anyone I suspect might share this feeling, anticipating that ignition of kinship that happens when the name lands. This may be what a cult hero is: the person you both want to tell no one and everyone about.</p><p>She does not, of course, have an audience of one. When I Googled her for this piece, I found an interview with Kim Gordon in which the former Sonic Youth guitarist and bassist drops Ribeiro’s name with characteristic casualness. “I like this Portuguese singer, Catherine Ribeiro. She’s pretty great. She’s Portuguese, though she sang in French.” My hoarder half was dismayed (“Now everyone will know! Thanks a LOT Kim”) and then my other half felt vain, self-congratulatory gratification (“a co-sign from Kim Gordon! What excellent taste I have!”).<br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T11:39:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\">The prog-rock sorceress’s work with Alpes has

It’s exactly the type of smooth sentimentality and silliness that a Sunday afternoon audience at Glastonbury deserves: from the gloriously gooey Penny Lover, to the chintzy You are my Destiny and the funk triumph of Brick House, Richie, dressed in a black blazer adorned with a glittered trim, packs every single second of the show with unbridled pop theatrics.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"437693b62f802656a124047e5f1b044eb10db847\"> \n   <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/437693b62f802656a124047e5f1b044eb10db847/0_0_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Richie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is it tea you’re looking for?</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Most vital to the Alabama-born singer’s Glastonbury debut is his knowing relationship with his audience, many of whom are wearing masks and T-shirts emblazoned with drawings of his face. Well aware of his camp charisma, he wins support from the crowd immediately, complimenting their ability to remember his lyrics, whipping them into a yobbish singalong for Three Times a Lady, and triggering some bolshie dance moves during Dancing on the Ceiling. The opening to the Commodores’ Easy even prompts a sigh of joy from the crowd. In contrast to Kanye’s cold, brutalist headline set the night before, Richie provides a reassuring hour of tender, tacky hits; mud melts into milk chocolate, the grey clouds are silky silver pillows, joy is restored. </p> \n  <p>Before capping off his set with All Night Long, he necks a glass of what looks like vodka cranberry, and thousands of fans and converts cheer and laugh. Lionel Richie: party starter, people pleaser, a Glastonbury highlight.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Lionel Richie\"> \n   <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; .title { display:block;} .face { width: 80px; height: 80px; margin: 0 -5px;} &lt;/style&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;title&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/ratinglabel.598b8588.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-28T18:06:51.009+01:00\">at 6.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T10:54:35.285+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\">Did the sun come back for a brief Sunday moment?

Phillips is a bit of an outsider, even a solipsist, who writes, produces and performs all of his songs, tracking each instrument himself on an old reel-to-reel. According to his forthcoming single - We Try But We Don’t Fit In - isolation is getting to him: he has even got a song, Nothing at All, that finds him moaning “What am I good for?”, answering himself: “Nothing at all”.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-25T16:11:19.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Lo-fi synth angst from Day Wave, Sunflower Bean hear voices, and Boycrush ft Madeira wreak lovely, summery electro fluff </p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497g4","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432548303249/76e165e9-8e2a-47ef-9ea5-6a01b5d29641-140x84.jpeg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"456902457","byline":"Paul Lester","internalPageCode":"2308450","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-05-28T12:08:18Z"},"tags":[{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/the-playlist","references":[],"description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world"},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/series/listen-up","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/listen-up","references":[],"description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n"},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/indie","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Indie","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/indie","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/indie","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paullester","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Paul Lester","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paullester","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/paullester","references":[],"bio":"<p>Paul Lester been contributing to the Guardian for most of this century.

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br /></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T11:54:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>With the third Vaccines album out next week, frontman Justin Young talks us through what the band

for the summer, it’s Hey Mama. Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited. Dirty rhythm, indeed! <strong><em>RLD</em></strong></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T19:12:59.558+01:00","standfirst":"<p>As the perennial debate begins over which songs will own the summer, our critics chime in with their favourites – and find mobile phones, yoga and polyamorous relationships are the big themes this year</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494kh","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6f65a2d48806a9f1cd339258b10e2be2584fdd5e/0_0_620_372/140.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"456851374","byline":"Rob LeDonne, Kate Hutchinson, Tshepo Mokoena, Harriet Gibsone, Gwilym Mumford  and Lanre Bakare","internalPageCode":"2306384","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-05-25T06:00:09Z"},"tags":[{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/nicki-minaj","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Nicki Minaj","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/nicki-minaj","references":[]},{"id":"music/janelle-monae","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Janelle Monae","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/janelle-monae","references":[]},{"id":"music/david-guetta","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"David Guetta","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/david-guetta","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/david-guetta","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rob-le-donne","type":"contributor","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Rob LeDonne","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rob-le-donne","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/rob-le-donne","references":[],"bio":"<p>Rob LeDonne is a freelance journalist and comedy writer.</p>","firstName":"ledonne","lastName":"rob","twitterHandle":"robledonne"},{"id":"profile/kate-hutchinson","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Kate Hutchinson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-hutchinson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/kate-hutchinson","references":[],"bio":"<p>Kate Hutchinson is deputy editor of the Guide.

– My Kinda Swag</strong></h2><p>Born in Devon but raised in Australia, Emmi has been writing songs for other singers over the last few years. As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly. Then the whole thing cracks open with the song’s almighty chorus (and that delicious post-chorus bit where she sings, “I like the kind of people that you roll with” is one of the highlights of 2015 so far).<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T16:49:14.384+01:00","standfirst":"<p>A cracking debut from Emmi, a call to arms from PYCO, plus Little Mix explore the breezier side of black magic</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4962p","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432286121897/a4c7f72d-5fee-4a7b-b9c4-c8f301004703-140x84.jpeg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"456870338","internalPageCode":"2307364","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-05-28T00:00:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/the-playlist","references":[],"description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world"},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/series/listen-up","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/listen-up","references":[],"description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n"},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/michaelcragg","references":[],"bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

Zeppelin’s 1976 album Presence was recorded under difficult circumstances. Robert Plant was recovering from the injuries he had received in a serious car accident the year before, and had to record his vocals from his wheelchair. The album received mixed reviews, which seems faintly incredible for a record containing Achilles’ Last Stand, Tea for One and Nobody’s Fault But Mine. </p><p>It’s one of the three Zeppelin records – alongside In Through the Out Door and Coda – that gets the full remaster/reissue treatment next month, and we’ve got this previously unreleased version of Hots on for Nowhere from the Presence reissue for your listening pleasure.

It’s exactly the type of smooth sentimentality and silliness that a Sunday afternoon audience at Glastonbury deserves: from the gloriously gooey Penny Lover, to the chintzy You are my Destiny and the funk triumph of Brick House, Richie, dressed in a black blazer adorned with a glittered trim, packs every single second of the show with unbridled pop theatrics.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"437693b62f802656a124047e5f1b044eb10db847\"> \n   <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/437693b62f802656a124047e5f1b044eb10db847/0_0_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Richie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is it tea you’re looking for?</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Most vital to the Alabama-born singer’s Glastonbury debut is his knowing relationship with his audience, many of whom are wearing masks and T-shirts emblazoned with drawings of his face. Well aware of his camp charisma, he wins support from the crowd immediately, complimenting their ability to remember his lyrics, whipping them into a yobbish singalong for Three Times a Lady, and triggering some bolshie dance moves during Dancing on the Ceiling. The opening to the Commodores’ Easy even prompts a sigh of joy from the crowd. In contrast to Kanye’s cold, brutalist headline set the night before, Richie provides a reassuring hour of tender, tacky hits; mud melts into milk chocolate, the grey clouds are silky silver pillows, joy is restored. </p> \n  <p>Before capping off his set with All Night Long, he necks a glass of what looks like vodka cranberry, and thousands of fans and converts cheer and laugh.

The lineup has undergone many changes in the 70 years since, but the current quartet still plays as if the same stuff is running through all their veins. There is next to no visible communication between players – something that can reinforce the impression of a certain coolness in the performance. But generally, no sooner is that impression formed than it is blown apart: the Borodins can be fiery even while looking efficient.</p><p>Each concert in this anniversary series is devoted to Beethoven and Shostakovich. Here they opened with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPBvS4Pj2HM\">Beethoven’s “Harp” Quartet</a>, Op 74, and after a tender start brought out a dense, rich tone that flourished in the inner lines in the slow movement, and that made the middle section of the third movement, a Bach-like fugue, sound as if it were being played on a huge, clangorous organ. They finished with Op 18, No 1: crisp and springy in the fast movements, and with an old-school weightiness in the slow movement, and lots of variety of colour, even if they almost never play truly

href=\"http://www.aldeburgh.co.uk/\">Aldeburgh festival</a> ended on a high, with <a href=\"http://www.harrisonparrott.com/artist/profile/oliver-knussen\">Oliver Knussen</a> conducting the excellent <a href=\"http://www.brittenpears.org/\">Britten-Pears Orchestra</a> in a rare concert performance of Benjamin Britten’s only ballet music, <a href=\"http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Benjamin-Britten-The-Prince-of-the-Pagodas/294\">The Prince of the Pagodas</a>. It was the only work still unpublished at the time of his death and, as such, is not generally regarded as top-drawer Britten. Knussen has nevertheless always been a strong advocate.</p><p>This was a persuasive reading, brilliantly articulated, and the extended solos were delivered by the orchestra’s young principals with considerable accomplishment. Already something of an occasion, it was given an even more dynamic context by being prefaced by a Balinese gamelan-inspired piece written by <a href=\"http://www.pytheasmusic.org/mcphee.html\">Colin McPhee</a>, the composer/musicologist responsible for introducing Britten to this exotic soundworld. Tabuh-Tabuhan, subtitled Toccata for Orchestra and Two Pianos, dates from 1936: McPhee’s faithful reproduction of the gamelan sound in his core concertino lineup of two pianos, celeste, xylophone, marimba and glockenspiel felt radical; their timbres exotic, the pounding ostinati astonishingly vibrant and modern. Inevitably, it drew attention to the moments when the Pagodas score sounded a bit English: the brass and string writing sometimes typically Britten, and the alto saxophone sounding as if it had crept in from somewhere else again. Yet the theatricality of his intentions was finely realised. <br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T15:30:33.493+01:00","standfirst":"<p

musical universe","body":"<p>The stage set-ups tell the story of this micro-festival curated by Mogwai, the centrepiece of their All Tomorrow’s Parties season at the Roundhouse. A menacing line of speaker stacks pushes Lightning Bolt right to the edge; the duo have just a slim envelope of space in which to slot themselves, a neat visual metaphor for the deliberate constrictions they place on themselves musically. Brian Chippendale plays drums and occasionally screeches into a microphone attached to a clown mask; Brian Gibson plays bass. What emerges is a pulverising avalanche of noise. Gibson feeds his bass through a palette of pedals that transform his blues chords and rippling arpeggios into screams of catastrophe, while Chippendale pounds the drums as though trying to demolish skyscrapers: a combined roar that shifts in tone and pace with a subtlety that is surprisingly organic.</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related:

weekends trudging through mud with glitter on his face carrying a flag that says PAUL AND SPUD’S BARMY ARMY. “Not just us, but The Who as well.” The audience roar: there are people here in FUCK KANYE T-shirts and a lot of blokes with Liam Gallagher hair. But these days, at least, Weller is nowhere near as musically conservative as some of his fans. The hits understandably get the biggest response – Changing Man, You Do Something To Me, That’s Entertainment, a slightly trudgy version of Start!, a sparkier take on A Town Called Malice that concludes the set – but the most intriguing stuff he plays is off his most recent album, Saturn’s Pattern: if it’s less fragmented and strange than its predecessor, Sonik Kicks, there’s still something exploratory and off-kilter about the piano-powered title track, and the dense, ominous psychedelia of opener White Sky.</p><figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f16ffa68a530f7268f46030f99f6867e20dd36f\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6f16ffa68a530f7268f46030f99f6867e20dd36f/0_0_3846_2838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Weller performs on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"738\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Weller performs on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Ryan/Invision/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-28T23:45:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\"><strong>Pyramid stage</strong><br>Weller, Townshend, Daltrey and co. are in crowd-pleasing mode tonight, swinging microphones and charming the Glasto audience with veteran panache</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3p5","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/de1446951e65217fdde723394698f2cd09f53d4d/0_58_3286_1972/140.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457251396","starRating":"4","byline":"Alexis Petridis","internalPageCode":"2325461","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-28T00:15:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/glastonbury-2015","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/music-festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music festivals","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music-festivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music-festivals","references":[],"description":"Latest news, reviews and blogs from music festivals around the world"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/glastonbury","references":[]},{"id":"culture/festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Festivals","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/festivals","references":[]},{"id":"music/who","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The Who","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/who","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/who","references":[]},{"id":"music/paulweller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Paul Weller","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/paulweller","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/paulweller","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/livereview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/livereview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alexispetridis","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Alexis Petridis","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexispetridis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alexispetridis","references":[],"bio":"<p>Alexis Petridis is the Guardian's head rock and pop critic and the music editor of GQ magazine.

soundtrack to Empire entered the US charts at No 1 in March, no one could have been particularly surprised, with one possible exception: Madonna, who unexpectedly found herself debuting at No 2. All that effort promoting your new album – the interviews, the online courting of controversy, unceremoniously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/25/madonna-falls-but-it-was-the-brit-awards-that-took-a-tumble\">falling on your arse at the Brits</a> – and you’re pipped at the post by one of the oldest tricks in the book, the one that Micky Dolenz of the Monkees famously described as “the equivalent of Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan”. It’s almost 60 years since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvUGi0xBm84\">Ricky Nelson performed Fats Domino’s I’m Walkin’</a> on his parents’ sitcom and ended up a real-life pop star, but launching a musical career by pretending to have a musical career on a TV show still seems to work like a dream. It’s not just that the soundtrack album of Empire – a soapy musical drama about a feuding family and their urban entertainment company that’s swiftly become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/25/lee-daniels-taraji-p-henson-empire\">one of the biggest TV shows in the US</a> – was successful: two members of the cast now have major-label deals in their own right.

half minutes in which a wistful waltz transforms itself into a brittle pre-echo of the Tenth Symphony. It dates from 1945; Linus Roth brings to it an intense, deep sonority. Also new is Mieczyslaw Weinberg’s Rhapsody on Moldavian Themes in its orchestral version – a gloomy meditation that suddenly acquires vivid virtuosic strength. Weinberg’s attractive Concertino is overshadowed by the disc’s masterpiece, the wartime Concerto funebre of Karl Amadeus Hartmann, with its mournful final Russian chorale. Fine playing, but you can’t find many wartime consolations in this music.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T11:47:55.000+01:00","standfirst":"Linus Roth, Württemberg Chamber Orchestra (Challenge)","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5gh","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435237972213/Wurttemberg-Chamber-Orche-003.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457271692","starRating":"4","byline":"Nicholas Kenyon","internalPageCode":"2326688","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-18T12:56:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]},{"id":"music/dmitri-shostakovich","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Dmitri Shostakovich","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/dmitri-shostakovich","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/dmitri-shostakovich","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"tone/albumreview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nicholas-kenyon","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Nicholas Kenyon","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholas-kenyon","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/nicholas-kenyon","references":[],"bio":"<p>Nicholas Kenyon is managing director of the Barbican Centre and was director of the BBC Proms from 1996 to 2007.

It’s what Billie Holiday did. Karin Krog is one of the few who do it today and no one does it better. She is Norwegian, but sings in English with surpassing ease and subtlety. Steve Kuhn is a superb pianist with a quite remarkable spread of jazz styles under his fingers and together they make an outstanding partnership. In a near-perfect set of classic songs and jazz themes with added lyrics, they succeed in making something memorable every time. They are joined on various tracks by saxophonists Eric Alexander and John Surman and the late trumpeter Lew

Nestled midway through the album, that song’s pin-drop clarity acts a breather from the first half’s swampy psychedelic funk and X-rated jams (The Valley is worth the PG sticker alone), while the second half channels <em>Sign ‘o’ the Times</em>-era Prince, all thrusting guitar riffs and glorious falsetto. Densely layered and richly rewarding, <em>Wildheart</em> is further evidence that Miguel suits his outsider status.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T11:47:55.000+01:00","standfirst":"(RCA)","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3gt","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435062182093/cc6a1cd9-e5fc-4bda-a0e0-2740fee12673-140x84.jpeg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457247450","starRating":"4","byline":"Michael Cragg","internalPageCode":"2325231","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-19T23:19:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/r-and-b","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"R&B","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/r-and-b","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/r-and-b","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/albumreview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"music/urban","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Urban music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/urban","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/urban","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/michaelcragg","references":[],"bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

Malcolm Martineau, the guiding force on this project, have united for the final volume of the 150-plus Poulenc songs, written over 44 years. The works here are for voice and various mixed ensembles. The opening Rapsodie N&egrave;gre (1917) reflects the young composer’s keen if naive fascination with the “exotic”. Le Bestiaire (the piano-only version appeared on Vol 4) sets poems by Apollinaire depicting among other things the “melancholy” carp, the crayfish and the grasshopper. There are more settings by Apollinaire and Max Jacob, including Banalit&eacute;s and Le Bal Masqu&eacute;. Thomas Allen, Thomas Oliemans, Joshua Ellicott, Catherine Wyn-Rogers, Ann Murray and Sarah Fox are all secure and idiomatic Poulenc connoisseurs.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T11:47:55.000+01:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Martineau  (piano) <br />(Signum)","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4gh","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435164335518/Francis-Poulenc-Helios-001.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457259666","starRating":"3","byline":"Fiona Maddocks","internalPageCode":"2325959","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-19T08:00:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/albumreview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/fiona-maddocks","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Fiona Maddocks","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-maddocks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/fiona-maddocks","references":[],"bio":"<p>Fiona Maddocks is the Observer's classical critic.

There are nods to indie’s artier fringes in its occasional twitchy bass lines and a cappella breakdowns, but this is a record so unabashed in its bid for festival glory that the first woah-oahed vocal hook arrives 10 seconds in. On these terms, it may be a success; it’s well stocked with melodies that you can imagine being bellowed back at him by sodden crowds. But you can’t help feeling that the anthemic uplift of these songs is too generic to last much beyond the

doubt Ezra Furman will ever be a star, topping the charts, headlining festivals, getting photographed in the gossip pages. He’s unlikely star material after all, a young man in a dress and vigorously applied make-up, singing about his Jewish faith, his depression, his anger and his joy, to a backing of 50s rock’n’roll, interspersed with bits of garage rock and Velvet Undergroundish R&amp;B. Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home from the show.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T15:57:21.836+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The Chicagoan singer is the kind of performer who makes you feel like a teenager all

Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air Supply","body":"<p>It is 2am on Tuesday at a mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T00:00:44.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>In Jamaica, no one can hear you scream ‘bad taste’, which is why you are as likely to hear

The first is ridiculous: to jealously hoard her as my private heroine, my precious personal discovery. And the second is quite the opposite: to speculatively, hopefully drop her name to anyone I suspect might share this feeling, anticipating that ignition of kinship that happens when the name lands. This may be what a cult hero is: the person you both want to tell no one and everyone about.</p><p>She does not, of course, have an audience of one. When I Googled her for this piece, I found an interview with Kim Gordon in which the former Sonic Youth guitarist and bassist drops Ribeiro’s name with characteristic casualness. “I like this Portuguese singer, Catherine Ribeiro. She’s pretty great. She’s Portuguese, though she sang in French.” My hoarder half was dismayed (“Now everyone will know! Thanks a LOT Kim”) and then my other half felt vain, self-congratulatory gratification (“a co-sign from Kim Gordon! What excellent taste I have!”).<br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T11:39:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\">The prog-rock sorceress’s work with Alpes has

Friends, therapy – and red wine","body":"<p>Joy Williams had an unusual journey into music, because pop and rock were strangers in the family home when she was growing up in California. Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it. Until one day the teenage Williams went for a meeting with her drama teacher about a play her high school was putting on.</p><p>“I saw this disc and it said, ‘<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jimi-hendrix-biopic-london-1967-changed-sound-for-ever\">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/26/jimmy-page-robert-plant-how-we-made-led-zeppelin-iii\">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a>,’” the singer says. “I said, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘You don’t know who they are?’ ‘No.’ And he said: ‘You need that more than I do.’ And I wore that CD out.” Doors were opened and music flooded in, especially once she got a car and had access to a radio outside the conservative, Christian family home. “The first time I heard the Beatles it was like my brain was melting, in all the right ways. Why have I missed out on hearing this? And I don’t think it was because my parents tried to hide it from me – they just weren’t listening to it.”</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-01T18:21:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The singer had to reinvent herself after the dramatic implosion of the Civil Wars.

I’m having a late start, because I had a meeting last night with Chuck Lorre, the creator of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/feb/25/two-and-a-half-men-sheen-charlie\">Two and a Half Men</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-big-bang-theory\">The Big Bang Theory</a>.

I thought songs were so simple that I could do five of them a day, but songs that sound simple are deceptive. It’s a very complicated process. So I left my job as pianist for the Ames Brothers [singing quartet] to go and start writing at the <a href=\"http://www.thebrillbuilding.com/wp-content/gallery/the-building/img_5693.jpg\">Brill Building</a> (1), but had no success.

Alongside Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Kinison, they were to be guests on Saturday Night Live, the comedy institution that was must-see TV in US households. They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-22T14:27:20.053+01:00","standfirst":"They wound up audiences, were often too drunk to play and got banned from late-night TV.

But now it goes like this: in recent years, some of English folk’s best young players and new groups have sprung up to bow, squeeze and blow new life into the lost world of old English dances, freeing them from centuries of stillness in <a href=\"http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/playford_1651/\">antique songbooks</a>. </p><p>Traditional English songs have been kept at the forefront of contemporary British folk culture by singers ranging from <a href=\"http://www.thecopperfamily.com\">the Copper family</a> in the 1950s through to <a href=\"http://samleesong.co.uk\">Sam Lee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jackieoates.co.uk\">Jackie Oates</a> today. But it’s not until these last few years that the much more obscure English tune tradition is being revived and redefined by a new wave of groups, and now, some of those old tunes are beginning to move again, and in unexpected ways.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-05-13T11:18:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Instrumental acts such as Spiro and Leveret are part of a new wave of

But one thing you almost never see is a performer using a torrential downpour of rain to their advantage, which is one of the things that makes <strong>Mary J Blige</strong>’s Friday afternoon appearance on the Pyramid stage a genuinely remarkable event. She announces that she’s never been to Glastonbury before – handy clarification for anyone who thought they saw the self-styled Queen of Hip-Hop Soul down the front for Ozric Tentacles in 93 – but her performance is dazzlingly slick. Then she plays a startlingly intense version of the title track of her 2001 album No More Drama, crouching on the rain-lashed lip of the stage, as if she’s treating the elements as a special effect, amping up the song’s harrowing, cathartic power. Her voice is incredible, all the more so if you’ve spent the earlier part of the afternoon listening to some pretty wan-sounding alt-rock bands. When it ends, the audience goes so nuts for so long that her band can’t start the next song. Looking out over the field, Blige bursts into tears.</p><figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dde0a2a9432df12eeed34ee9fb85c51303e5f1b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508437217/f5519297-e292-4dd1-8bd1-a536aa07aff3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Redferns via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-29T16:25:54.642+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\">Florence Welch pulled out all the stops, while Kanye’s set was faltering and relatively restrained.

Squire, the band’s bass player, retained ownership of the Yes name even during a period of instability in the late 1980s, when other members split away to form Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. He was the only member to play on every one of Yes’s 21 studio albums, from their debut, Yes (1969), to Heaven &amp; Earth (2014); and helped to write much of the band’s material.</p><p>While many fans regard the group’s 70s work, such as The Yes Album (1971), Close to the Edge (1972) and Tales From Topographic Oceans (1973), as their creative pinnacle, it was 90125 – recorded after the group had split up and then reformed – that became their most commercially successful.

On Friday afternoon, when the lead singer of Catfish and the Bottlemen tells the audience at the Other stage he hopes they enjoy Kanye, the sentiment is greeted with boos. Among his fans, there’s a feeling that no one knows quite how his performance is going to pan out: in the past, he’s certainly been great live, but equally, YouTube is full of cameraphone footage of audiences expressing their vocal disapproval of his decision to stop playing music and instead treating them to a lengthy, extempore monologue on his misunderstood genius. As he takes the stage, the question of which way it’s going to go hangs in the air. </p><p>Initially, it’s spectacularly thrilling. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/29/jayz.urban\">Jay Z headlined Glastonbury</a>, he went out of his way to win the crowd over at the start of his set: opening by making a joke of Noel Gallagher’s complaints about his presence on the bill by performing a cover of Wonderwall, turning on the charm. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-28T19:31:14.300+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\"><strong>Pyramid stage<br></strong>The hip-hop giant proclaims himself the greatest living rock star, and his set has a potent ferocity – but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd<strong><br></strong></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3zd","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/39da1f7ed93e3fe7e1f0f041bc2832c6d72afd73/426_93_3079_1849/140.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"457251258","starRating":"3","byline":"Alexis Petridis","internalPageCode":"2325442","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-07-28T00:15:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/glastonbury-2015","references":[]},{"id":"music/kanyewest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Kanye West","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/kanyewest","references":[]},{"id":"music/hip-hop","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Hip-hop","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/hip-hop","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/music-festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music festivals","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music-festivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music-festivals","references":[],"description":"Latest news, reviews and blogs from music festivals around the world"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/glastonbury","references":[]},{"id":"culture/festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Festivals","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/festivals","references":[]},{"id":"music/rap","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Rap","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rap","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/rap","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/livereview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/livereview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alexispetridis","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Alexis Petridis","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexispetridis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alexispetridis","references":[],"bio":"<p>Alexis Petridis is the Guardian's head rock and pop critic and the music editor of GQ magazine.

Ribeiro threatens dark magic, even as she teeters at the brink of epic","body":"<p>Listening to Catherine Ribeiro, a little-known prog-rock sorceress who released a slew of impeccable records in France in the 1970s with her band Alpes, I’m split between two adolescent impulses. The first is ridiculous: to jealously hoard her as my private heroine, my precious personal discovery. And the second is quite the opposite: to speculatively, hopefully drop her name to anyone I suspect might share this feeling, anticipating that ignition of kinship that happens when the name lands. This may be what a cult hero is: the person you both want to tell no one and everyone about.</p><p>She does not, of course, have an audience of one. When I Googled her for this piece, I found an interview with Kim Gordon in which the former Sonic Youth guitarist and bassist drops Ribeiro’s name with characteristic casualness. “I like this Portuguese singer, Catherine Ribeiro. She’s pretty great. She’s Portuguese, though she sang in French.” My hoarder half was dismayed (“Now everyone will know! Thanks a LOT Kim”) and then my other half felt vain, self-congratulatory gratification (“a co-sign from Kim Gordon! What excellent taste I have!”).<br /></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-06-30T11:39:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p data-dropid=\"0\">The prog-rock sorceress’s work with Alpes has

It’s exactly the type of smooth sentimentality and silliness that a Sunday afternoon audience at Glastonbury deserves: from the gloriously gooey Penny Lover, to the chintzy You are my Destiny and the funk triumph of Brick House, Richie, dressed in a black blazer adorned with a glittered trim, packs every single second of the show with unbridled pop theatrics.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"437693b62f802656a124047e5f1b044eb10db847\"> \n   <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/437693b62f802656a124047e5f1b044eb10db847/0_0_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Richie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is it tea you’re looking for?</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Most vital to the Alabama-born singer’s Glastonbury debut is his knowing relationship with his audience, many of whom are wearing masks and T-shirts emblazoned with drawings of his face. Well aware of his camp charisma, he wins support from the crowd immediately, complimenting their ability to remember his lyrics, whipping them into a yobbish singalong for Three Times a Lady, and triggering some bolshie dance moves during Dancing on the Ceiling. The opening to the Commodores’ Easy even prompts a sigh of joy from the crowd. In contrast to Kanye’s cold, brutalist headline set the night before, Richie provides a reassuring hour of tender, tacky hits; mud melts into milk chocolate, the grey clouds are silky silver pillows, joy is restored. </p> \n  <p>Before capping off his set with All Night Long, he necks a glass of what looks like vodka cranberry, and thousands of fans and converts cheer and laugh.
